abstract = {We develop a theory of electric-field-induced magnetization of a medium. The relevant polarizability, , simultaneously violates the inversion symmetry (parity), the time-reversal symmetry, and the combined CP symmetry. We focus on two fundamental mechanisms mediating the appearance of —the electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM) and the electron-nucleus pseudo-scalar weak neutral currents. Measuring may reveal so-far elusive eEDM and these neutral currents. We start with computing for rare-gas atoms and demonstrate that scales steeply as Z5 with the nuclear charge Z. Further, we show that manifests itself in permanent CP-violating magnetic moments of molecules. A macroscopic sample of polarized molecules would exhibit a magnetization correlated with the direction of externally-applied polarizing electric field. We numerically estimate this unconventional moment for diamagnetic molecules. Finally, we introduce a thermally-induced CP-violating magnetization of a sample of paramagnetic molecules. In all cases, we evaluate the feasibility of an experimental search for eEDM. We find that paramagnetic molecules HgH embedded in a rare-gas matrix at a temperature of a few Kelvin have a remarkable sensitivity to eEDM. We conclude, that experiments with such “artificial solids” can push the current limit on the eEDM by several orders of magnitude, deep into the domain of predictions of competing extensions to the Standard Model of elementary particles.},

abstract = {The formation of molecules and supramolecular structures results from bonding by conservative forces acting among electrons and nuclei and giving rise to equilibrium configurations defined by minima of the interaction potential. Here we show that bonding can also occur by the non-conservative forces responsible for interaction-induced coherent population trapping. The bound state arises in a dissipative process and manifests itself as a stationary state at a preordained interatomic distance. Remarkably, such a dissipative bonding is present even when the interactions among the atoms are purely repulsive. The dissipative bound states can be created and studied spectroscopically in present-day experiments with ultracold atoms or molecules and can potentially serve for cooling strongly interacting quantum gases.},

@article{Ooi2003,
abstract = {A general scheme for reducing the center-of-mass entropy is proposed. It is based on the repetition of a cycle, composed of three concepts: velocity selection, deceleration and irreversible accumulation. Well-known laser techniques are used to represent these concepts: Raman $\pi$-pulse for velocity selection, STIRAP for deceleration, and a single spontaneous emission for irreversible accumulation. No closed pumping cycle nor repeated spontaneous emissions are required, so the scheme is applicable to cool a molecular gas. The quantum dynamics are analytically modelled using the density matrix. It is shown that during the coherent processes the gas is translationally cooled. The internal states serve as an entropy sink, in addition to spontaneous emission. This scheme provides new possibilities to translationally laser-cool molecules for high precision molecular spectroscopy and interferometry.},

@article{Shuman2010,
abstract = {It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a wide array of fields. Laser cooling has not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications. For example, heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments that lead to long-range, tunable, anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions. The combination of the dipole-dipole interaction and the precise control over molecular degrees of freedom possible at ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates for use in quantum simulations of condensed-matter systems and in quantum computation. Also, ultracold molecules could provide unique opportunities for studying chemical dynamics and for tests of fundamental symmetries. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of the polar molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF). Using an optical cycling scheme requiring only three lasers, we have observed both Sisyphus and Doppler cooling forces that reduce the transverse temperature of a SrF molecular beam substantially, to a few millikelvin or less. At present, the only technique for producing ultracold molecules is to bind together ultracold alkali atoms through Feshbach resonance or photoassociation. However, proposed applications for ultracold molecules require a variety of molecular energy-level structures (for example unpaired electronic spin, Omega doublets and so on). Our method provides an alternative route to ultracold molecules. In particular, it bridges the gap between ultracold (submillikelvin) temperatures and the ∼1-K temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (for example with cryogenic buffer-gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams). Ultimately, our technique should allow the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for species that are chemically distinct from bialkalis.},

abstract = {Cryogenically cooled buffer gas beam sources of the molecule thorium monoxide (ThO) are optimized and characterized. Both helium and neon buffer gas sources are shown to produce ThO beams with high flux, low divergence, low forward velocity, and cold internal temperature for a variety of stagnation densities and nozzle diameters. The beam operates with a buffer gas stagnation density of ∼10(15)-10(16) cm(-3) (Reynolds number ∼1-100), resulting in expansion cooling of the internal temperature of the ThO to as low as 2 K. For the neon (helium) based source, this represents cooling by a factor of about 10 (2) from the initial nozzle temperature of about 20 K (4 K). These sources deliver ∼10(11) ThO molecules in a single quantum state within a 1-3 ms long pulse at 10 Hz repetition rate. Under conditions optimized for a future precision spectroscopy application [A. C. Vutha et al., J. Phys. B: At., Mol. Opt. Phys., 2010, 43, 074007], the neon-based beam has the following characteristics: forward velocity of 170 m s(-1), internal temperature of 3.4 K, and brightness of 3 × 10(11) ground state molecules per steradian per pulse. Compared to typical supersonic sources, the relatively low stagnation density of this source and the fact that the cooling mechanism relies only on collisions with an inert buffer gas make it widely applicable to many atomic and molecular species, including those which are chemically reactive, such as ThO.},

abstract = {Atomic physics was revolutionized by the development of forced evaporative cooling, which led directly to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum-degenerate Fermi gases and ultracold optical lattice simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases. Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases, dynamics and chemistry. However, although advances have been made in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH(•)) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach.},

@article{Veseth1976,
abstract = {A theoretical description of the Zeeman effect in a diatomic molecule is given on the basis of exact numerical diagonalization of the perturbation matrix. In this way it is also possible to include the fine and hyperfine structures to the desired degree of accuracy, and this is highly important for a complete theory of the molecular Zeeman effect. The present paper gives matrix elements for the Zeeman Hamiltonian which cover all types of valence states in a diatomic molecule. The molecular parameters are determined by a weighted nonlinear least-squares fit which includes electron paramagnetic resonance and laser magnetic resonance as well as zero-field data. Hence, the present method yields a direct determination of the basic molecular g-factors instead of effective ones for each rotational level. The 2?? ground states of OH and SH serve as test examples. Fitted values for gl + 1 2gs are 2.00092(3) and 2.000889(4) for OH and SH, respectively, while the respective theoretical ones are 2.00087 and 2.000951. ?? 1976.},

In this setup gauginos are at the TeV scale, while sfermions are heavier by a loop factor. We cover the most sensitive low energy probes including electric dipole moments (EDMs), meson oscillations and charged lepton flavor violation (LFV) transitions. A leading log resummation of the large logs of gluino to sfermion mass ratio is performed. A sensitivity to PeV squark masses is obtained at present from kaon mixing measurements. A number of observables, including neutron EDMs, mu-{\textgreater}e transitions and charmed meson mixing, will start probing sfermion masses in the 100 TeV-1000 TeV range with the projected improvements in the experimental sensitivities. We also discuss the implications of our results for a variety of models that address the flavor hierarchy of quarks and leptons. We find that EDM searches will be a robust probe of models in which fermion masses are generated radiatively, while LFV searches remain sensitive to simple-texture based flavor models.},

@article{Chin2006,
abstract = {The study of superfluid fermion pairs in a periodic potential has important ramifications for understanding superconductivity in crystalline materials. By using cold atomic gases, various models of condensed matter can be studied in a highly controllable environment. Weakly repulsive fermions in an optical lattice could undergo d-wave pairing at low temperatures, a possible mechanism for high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides. The lattice potential could also strongly increase the critical temperature for s-wave superfluidity. Recent experimental advances in bulk atomic gases include the observation of fermion-pair condensates and high-temperature superfluidity. Experiments with fermions and bosonic bound pairs in optical lattices have been reported but have not yet addressed superfluid behaviour. Here we report the observation of distinct interference peaks when a condensate of fermionic atom pairs is released from an optical lattice, implying long-range order (a property of a superfluid). Conceptually, this means that s-wave pairing and coherence of fermion pairs have now been established in a lattice potential, in which the transport of atoms occurs by quantum mechanical tunnelling and not by simple propagation. These observations were made for interactions on both sides of a Feshbach resonance. For larger lattice depths, the coherence was lost in a reversible manner, possibly as a result of a transition from superfluid to insulator. Such strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice can be used to study a new class of hamiltonians with interband and atom-molecule couplings.},

We produce a BEC in three main steps: loading of the crossed dipole trap from laser-cooled atoms, an intermediate evaporative cooling stage which results in efficient loading of the auxiliary dimple trap, and a final evaporative cooling stage in the dimple trap. Our protocol is implemented in a compact setup and allows us to reach quantum degeneracy even with relatively modest initial atom numbers and available laser power.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a scheme for magneto-optically trapping strontium monofluoride (SrF) molecules at temperatures one order of magnitude lower and phase space densities three orders of magnitude higher than obtained previously with laser-cooled molecules. In our trap, optical dark states are destabilized by rapidly and synchronously reversing the trapping laser polarizations and the applied magnetic field gradient. The number of molecules and trap lifetime are also significantly improved from previous work by loading the trap with high laser power and then reducing the power for long-term trapping. With this procedure, temperatures as low as 400 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}K are achieved.},

@article{Wood1998d,
abstract = {A new approach has been developed for modelling the expansion of laser-generated plumes into low pressure gases, where, initially, the mean free path may be long enough for interpenetration of the plume and background. Although relatively simple in structure, it gives excellent fits to new experimental data for Si in He and Ar, and provides for the first time a detailed, coherent explanation of the observed splitting of the plume into a fast and a slow component. The model is based on a combination of multiple elastic scattering and hydrodynamic formulations. The plume is broken into orders corresponding to the number of collisions made with the background. The first order reaches the detector without any scattering, the second order undergoes one scattering event, and so forth. While particles can only be transferred between the various orders by collisions, the densities in the individual orders propagate to give the overall plume expansion. The propagation is determined by the usual equations for the conservation of mass and momentum. Representative results from the calculations are presented, and the probable role of the background gas in nanoparticle formation is discussed.},

Magnetic tuning of the spectral features recorded at high resolution (full width at half maximum ≅ 35 MHz) and at a field strength of 4.5 kG is accurately modeled using an effective Zeeman Hamiltonian. The determined magnetic g-factors for the X(4)$\Phi$(3/2) (v = 0) state deviate only slightly from those expected for an isolated (4)$\Phi$(3/2) state whereas those for the B(4)$\Gamma$(5/2)(v = 0) deviate significantly from those of an isolated (4)$\Gamma$(5/2) state. The rotational dependence of the magnetic tuning in the B(4)$\Gamma$(5/2)(v = 0) state is attributed to perturbations from a nearby (4)$\Phi$ state.},

abstract = {Transitions in atoms and molecules provide an ideal test ground for constraining or detecting a possible variation of the fundamental constants of nature. In this perspective, we review molecular species that are of specific interest in the search for a drifting proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$. In particular, we outline the procedures that are used to calculate the sensitivity coefficients for transitions in these molecules and discuss current searches. These methods have led to a rate of change in $\mu$ bounded to 6 × 10(-14)/yr from a laboratory experiment performed in the present epoch. On a cosmological time scale, the variation is limited to ∣$\Delta$$\mu$∕$\mu$∣ {\textless} 10(-5) for look-back times of 10-12× 10(9) years and to ∣$\Delta$$\mu$∕$\mu$∣ {\textless} 10(-7) for look-back times of 7× 10(9) years. The last result, obtained from high-redshift observation of methanol, translates into $\mu$̇/$\mu$=(1.4±1.4)×10(-17)/yr if a linear rate of change is assumed.},

abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

Here we explore how transitions between two of these quantum states can be induced while the molecules are on the chip. We use CO (a 3-Pi(1), v=0) molecules, prepared in the J=1 rotational level, and induce the J=2 {\textless}-- J=1 rotational transition with narrow-band sub-THz (mm-wave) radiation. First, the mm-wave source is characterized using CO molecules in a freely propagating molecular beam, and both Rabi cycling and rapid adiabatic passage are examined. Then, we demonstrate that the mm-wave radiation can be coupled to CO molecules that are less than 50 micron above the chip. Finally, CO molecules are guided in the J=1 level to the center of the chip where they are pumped to the J=2 level, recaptured, and guided off the chip.},

abstract = {In many applications we obtain test statistics by combining estimates from different experiments or studies. The usual combined estimator of the overall effect in independent studies leads to systematic overestimates of the significance level, see LI, Sm, and ROTH (1994). This results in a great number of unjustified significant evidences. By examination of the convexity of composed functions involved and application of higher and inverse moments of the chi(2) distribution we propose corrections for the estimated standard deviation of the overall effect estimator. Analytical results and simulations show that we improve the estimated significance level in such models.},

The presence of argon buffer gas yielded rich rotational relaxation spectra allowing to enlarge the data set for the (3)(1)Pi state term values, as well as to observe Lambda splittings in a wide range of vibrational (v(')) and rotational (J(')) quantum numbers. The data field includes about 820 energy levels of (3)(1)Pi NaCs in the range from v(')=0 to 37 and from J(')=3 to 190, which corresponds to ca. 95{\%} of the potential well depth. Direct fit of the potential energy curve to the level energies is realized using the inverted perturbation approach method; a set of Dunham coefficients is also presented.},

Molecules placed in their first rotationally excited states are found to exhibit effective long-range repulsion for applied electric fields above a certain critical value, as previously shown for non-paramagnetic molecules. This repulsion can safely allow the molecules to scatter while reducing the risk of inelastic or chemically reactive collisions. Several molecular species of {\$}{\^{}}2\backslashSigma{\$} molecules of experimental interest -- RbSr, SrF, BaF, and YO -- are considered, and all are shown to exhibit orders of magnitude suppression in quenching rates in a sufficiently strong laboratory electric field. It is further shown that, for these molecules described by Hund's coupling case b, electronic and nuclear spins play the role of spectator with respect to the shielding.},

abstract = {The standard model of physics is built on the fundamental constants of nature, but it does not provide an explanation for their values, nor require their constancy over space and time. Here we set a limit on a possible cosmological variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$ by comparing transitions in methanol observed in the early universe with those measured in the laboratory. From radio-astronomical observations of PKS1830-211, we deduced a constraint of $\Delta$$\mu$/$\mu$ = (0.0 ± 1.0) × 10(-7) at redshift z = 0.89, corresponding to a look-back time of 7 billion years. This is consistent with a null result.},

abstract = {The properties of the HfF(+) cation are thought to be well-suited for investigations of the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) and temporal variations of the fine structure constant. Precision spectroscopic measurements involving the X(1)$\Sigma$(+) and low-lying (3)$\Delta$(1) states have been proposed to measure both. Due to the lack of data for HfF(+), the design of these experiments has relied entirely on the predictions of electronic structure calculations. Spectroscopic characterizations of the X(1)$\Sigma$(+), (3)$\Delta$(1), (3)$\Delta$(2) and (3)$\Delta$(3) states are reported. The results further support the contention that HfF(+) is a viable candidate for eEDM measurements. The spacings between adjacent X(1)$\Sigma$(+) and (3)$\Delta$(1) levels are found to be less favorable for the proposed studies of the fine structure constant.},

@article{MellesGriotCorporation2006,
abstract = {In most laser applications it is necessary to focus, modify, or shape the laser beam by using lenses and other optical elements. In general, laser-beam propagation can be approximated by assuming that the laser beam has an ideal Gaussian intensity profile, which corresponds to the theoretical TEM00 mode. Coherent Gaussian beams have peculiar transformation properties which require special consideration. In order to select the best optics for a particular laser application, it is important to understand the basic properties of Gaussian beams. Unfortunately, the output from real-life lasers is not truly Gaussian (although the output of a single mode fiber is a very close approximation). To accom- modate this variance, a quality factor, M2 (called the M-squared factor), has been defined to describe the deviation of the laser beam from a theoretical Gaussian. For a theoretical Gaussian, M2 = 1; for a real laser beam, M2{\textgreater}1. The M2 factor for helium neon lasers is typically less than 1.1; for ion lasers, the M2 factor typically is between 1.1 and 1.3. Collimated TEM00 diode laser beams usually have an M2 ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. For high-energy multimode lasers, the M2 factor can be as high as 25 or 30. In all cases, the M2 factor affects the characteristics of a laser beam and cannot be neglected in optical designs. In the following section, Gaussian Beam Propagation, we will treat the characteristics of a theoretical Gaussian beam (M2=1); then, in the section Real Beam Propagation we will show how these characteristics change as the beam deviates from the theoretical. In all cases, a circularly symmetric wavefront is assumed, as would be the case for a helium neon laser or an argon-ion laser. Diode laser beams are asymmetric and often astigmatic, which causes their transformation to be more complex},

abstract = {Intrapulse quantum cascade laser spectrometers are able to produce both saturation and molecular alignment of the gas sample. This is due to the rapid sweep of the radiation through the absorption features. The intrapulse time domain spectra closely resemble those recorded in coherent optical nutation experiments. In the present paper, the frequency down-chirped technique is employed to investigate the nitrous oxide-foreign gas collisions. We have demonstrated that the measurements may be characterized by the induced polarization dominated and collision dominated measurement limits. The first of these is directly related to the time dependence of the long range collision cross sections. Among the collisional partners considered, carbon dioxide shows a very unusual behavior of rapid polarization damping, resulting in the production of symmetrical line shapes at very low gas buffer pressures. In the collision dominated regime, the pressure broadening parameters, which we have derived, are comparable at slow chirp rates, with those derived from other experimental methods. By comparing the pressure broadening coefficients of Ar, N(2), and CO(2) with those of He, making use of the chirp rate independence of the pressure broadening by helium, we have shown that at higher chirp rates there is clear evidence of the chirp-rate dependence of the pressure broadening parameters of N(2) and CO(2).},

abstract = {The time-of-flight (TOF) technique was used to study the aerodynamical acceleration in seeded supersonic molecular beams of heavy molecules and light seeding gas. We also studied the correlation between the degree of aerodynamic acceleration achieved, and rotational-vibrational temperatures as measured using the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. The velocity slip (difference) between helium and hydrogen carrier gases and iodine and aniline heavy molecules was determined in free-jet expansion by TOF measurements and compared with rotational temperatures measured by LIF. The helium translational temperature was found to be abnormally high and dependent on teh heavy-molecule concentration, even at concentration as low as 400 ppm. In the case of iodine it was found that the rotational degrees of freedom were equilibrated with the helium or hydrogen seeding gas translational and slip temperatures, although this temperature was more than an order of magnitude higher than theoretical predictions obtained for the pure-gas expansion. In aniline, the rotational temperature is found to be higher than the gas-dynamic temperature and rotational relaxation is incomplete. The heavy-molecule kinetic energy increases linearly with the light-gas pressure up to = 50{\%} of its maximum available kinetic energy. The possibility of making accurate heavy-molecule kinetic-energy measurements using the LIF technique is discussed. It is claimed that the existence of velocity slip can largely effect theoretical calculations concerning vibrational and rotational relaxation in seeded supersonic beams. ?? 1983.},

@article{Schmidt2015,
abstract = {During the last 70 years, the quantum theory of angular momentum has been successfully applied to describing the properties of nuclei, atoms, and molecules, their interactions with each other as well as with external fields. Due to the properties of quantum rotations, the angular momentum algebra can be of tremendous complexity even for a few interacting particles, such as valence electrons of an atom, not to mention larger many-particle systems. In this work, we study an example of the latter: a rotating quantum impurity coupled to a many-body bosonic bath. In the regime of strong impurity-bath couplings the problem involves addition of an infinite number of angular momenta which renders it intractable using currently available techniques. Here, we introduce a novel canonical transformation which allows to eliminate the complex angular momentum algebra from such a class of many-body problems. In addition, the transformation exposes the problem's constants of motion, and renders it solvable exactly in the limit of a slowly-rotating impurity. We exemplify the technique by showing that there exists a critical rotational speed at which the impurity suddenly acquires one quantum of angular momentum from the many-particle bath. Such an instability is accompanied by the deformation of the phonon density in the frame rotating along with the impurity.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art ab initio techniques have been applied to compute the potential energy curves for the SrYb molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electronic ground state and the first fifteen excited singlet and triplet states. All the excited state potential energy curves were computed using the equation of motion approach within the coupled-cluster singles and doubles framework and large basis-sets, while the ground state potential was computed using the coupled cluster method with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations. The leading long-range coefficients describing the dispersion interactions at large interatomic distances are also reported. The electric transition dipole moments have been obtained as the first residue of the polarization propagator computed with the linear response coupled-cluster method restricted to single and double excitations. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements have been evaluated using the multireference configuration interaction method restricted to single and double excitations with a large active space. The electronic structure data were employed to investigate the possibility of forming deeply bound ultracold SrYb molecules in an optical lattice in a photoassociation experiment using continuous-wave lasers. Photoassociation near the intercombination line transition of atomic strontium into the vibrational levels of the strongly spin-orbit mixed b(3)$\Sigma$(+), a(3)$\Pi$, A(1)$\Pi$, and C(1)$\Pi$ states with subsequent efficient stabilization into the v'' = 1 vibrational level of the electronic ground state is proposed. Ground state SrYb molecules can be accumulated by making use of collisional decay from v'' = 1 to v'' = 0. Alternatively, photoassociation and stabilization to v'' = 0 can proceed via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage provided that the trapping frequency of the optical lattice is large enough and phase coherence between the pulses can be maintained over at least tens of microseconds.},

abstract = {Mercury and the Moon both have tenuous atmospheres that contain atomic sodium and potassium. These chemicals must be continuously resupplied, as neither body can retain the atoms for more than a few hours. The mechanisms proposed to explain the resupply include sputtering of the surface by the solar wind, micrometeorite impacts, thermal desorption and photon-stimulated desorption. But there are few data and no general agreement about which processes dominate. Here we report laboratory studies of photon-stimulated desorption of sodium from surfaces that simulate lunar silicates. We find that bombardment of such surfaces at temperatures of approximately 250 K by ultraviolet photons (wavelength lambda {\textless} 300 nm) causes very efficient desorption of sodium atoms, induced by electronic excitations rather than by thermal processes or momentum transfer. The flux at the lunar surface of ultraviolet photons from the Sun is sufficient to ensure that photon-stimulated desorption of sodium contributes substantially to the Moon's atmosphere. On Mercury, solar heating of the surface implies that thermal desorption will also be an important source of atmospheric sodium.},

abstract = {The presence of long-range quantum spin correlations underlies a variety of physical phenomena in condensed matter systems, potentially including high-temperature superconductivity. However, many properties of exotic strongly correlated spin systems (e.g., spin liquids) have proved difficult to study, in part because calculations involving N-body entanglement become intractable for as few as N{\~{}}30 particles. Feynman divined that a quantum simulator - a special-purpose "analog" processor built using quantum particles (qubits) - would be inherently adept at such problems. In the context of quantum magnetism, a number of experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. However, simulations of quantum magnetism allowing controlled, tunable interactions between spins localized on 2D and 3D lattices of more than a few 10's of qubits have yet to be demonstrated, owing in part to the technical challenge of realizing large-scale qubit arrays. Here we demonstrate a variable-range Ising-type spin-spin interaction J{\_}ij on a naturally occurring 2D triangular crystal lattice of hundreds of spin-1/2 particles (9Be+ ions stored in a Penning trap), a computationally relevant scale more than an order of magnitude larger than existing experiments. We show that a spin-dependent optical dipole force can produce an antiferromagnetic interaction J{\_}ij {\~{}} 1/d{\_}ij{\^{}}a, where a is tunable over 0{\textless}a{\textless}3; d{\_}ij is the distance between spin pairs. These power-laws correspond physically to infinite-range (a=0), Coulomb-like (a=1), monopole-dipole (a=2) and dipole-dipole (a=3) couplings. Experimentally, we demonstrate excellent agreement with theory for 0.05{\textless}a{\textless}1.4. This demonstration coupled with the high spin-count, excellent quantum control and low technical complexity of the Penning trap brings within reach simulation of interesting and otherwise computationally intractable problems in quantum magnetism.},

abstract = {We review the high-resolution spectroscopic approach toward the study of intramolecular dynamics, emphasizing molecular parity violation. Theoretical work in the past decade has shown that parity-violating potentials in chiral molecules are much larger (typically one to two orders of magnitude) than anticipated on the basis of older theories. This makes experimental approaches toward small molecular parity-violating effects promising. The concepts and results of intramolecular dynamics derived from spectroscopy are analyzed as a sequence of symmetry breakings. We summarize the concepts of symmetry breakings (de facto and de lege) in view of parity violation in chiral molecules. The experimental schemes and the current status of spectroscopic experiments on molecular parity violation are established. We discuss the promises of detecting and accurately measuring parity-violating energy differences Delta(pv) E on the order of 10(11) J mol(1) (approximately 100 aeV) in enantiomers of chiral molecules with regard to their contribution to fundamental physics in the framework of the standard model of particle physics and more speculative future fundamental symmetry tests such as for the combined charge conjugation, parity, and time-reversal (CPT) symmetry violation.},

abstract = {Quantum magnetism originates from the exchange coupling between quantum mechanical spins. Here, we report on the observation of nearest-neighbor magnetic correlations emerging in the many-body state of a thermalized Fermi gas in an optical lattice. The key to obtaining short-range magnetic order is a local redistribution of entropy, which allows temperatures below the exchange energy for a subset of lattice bonds. When loading a repulsively interacting gas into either dimerized or anisotropic simple cubic configurations of a tunable-geometry lattice, we observe an excess of singlets as compared with triplets consisting of two opposite spins. For the anisotropic lattice, the transverse spin correlator reveals antiferromagnetic correlations along one spatial axis. Our work facilitates addressing open problems in quantum magnetism through the use of quantum simulation.},

@article{Joyce2014,
abstract = {After a decade and a half of research motivated by the accelerating universe, theory and experiment have a reached a certain level of maturity. The development of theoretical models beyond $\backslash$Lambda, or smooth dark energy, often called modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a host of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this review we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for anticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding principles for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and discuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing attempts to consistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion that additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must screen themselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into three broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high Newtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, and those for which second derivatives are important. Examples of the first class, such as f(R) gravity, employ the familiar chameleon or symmetron mechanisms, whereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive gravity theories, employing the Vainshtein mechanism. In each case, we describe the theories as effective theories. We describe experimental tests, summarizing laboratory and solar system tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmological tests. We discuss future tests which will be sensitive to different signatures of new physics in the gravitational sector. Parts that are more relevant to theorists vs. observers/experimentalists are clearly indicated, in the hope that this will serve as a useful reference for both audiences, as well as helping those interested in bridging the gap between them.},

The performance achieved with multiple diode models addresses the scarcity of commercial red laser diodes below 633 nm, which is a wavelength range relevant to spectroscopy of many molecules and ions. Using a combination of multiple-stage thermoelectric cooling and water cooling, the operating temperature of a laser diode is lowered to -64{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}C, more than 85{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}C below the ambient temperature. The laser system integrates temperature and diffraction grating feedback tunability for coarse and fine wavelength adjustments, respectively. For two different diode models, single-mode operation was achieved with 38 mW output power at 616.8 nm and 69 mW at 622.6 nm, more than 15 nm below their ambient temperature free-running wavelengths. The ECDL design can be used for diodes of any available wavelength, allowing individual diodes to be tuned continuously over tens of nanometers and extending the wavelength coverage of commercial laser diodes.},

abstract = {A network is frustrated when competing interactions between nodes prevent each bond from being satisfied. This compromise is central to the behaviour of many complex systems, from social and neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. Frustrated networks have highly degenerate ground states, with excess entropy and disorder even at zero temperature. In the case of quantum networks, frustration can lead to massively entangled ground states, underpinning exotic materials such as quantum spin liquids and spin glasses. Here we realize a quantum simulation of frustrated Ising spins in a system of three trapped atomic ions, whose interactions are precisely controlled using optical forces. We study the ground state of this system as it adiabatically evolves from a transverse polarized state, and observe that frustration induces extra degeneracy. We also measure the entanglement in the system, finding a link between frustration and ground-state entanglement. This experimental system can be scaled to simulate larger numbers of spins, the ground states of which (for frustrated interactions) cannot be simulated on a classical computer.},

abstract = {We have constructed an apparatus to study DC electrical breakdown in liquid helium at temperatures as low as 0.4 K and at pressures between the saturated vapor pressure and {\$}\backslashsim{\$}600 torr. The apparatus can house a set of electrodes that are 12 cm in diameter with a gap of {\$}1-2{\$} cm between them, and a potential up to {\$}\backslashpm 50{\$} kV can be applied to each electrode. Initial results demonstrated that it is possible to apply fields exceeding 100 kV/cm in a 1 cm gap between two electropolished stainless steel electrodes 12 cm in diameter for a wide range of pressures at 0.4 K. We also measured the current between two electrodes. Our initial results, {\$}I{\textless}1{\$} pA at 45 kV, correspond to a lower bound on the effective volume resistivity of LHe of {\$}\backslashrho{\_}V {\textgreater} 5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}18{\}}{\$} {\$}\backslashOmega\backslashcdot{\$}cm. This lower bound is 5 times larger than the bound previously measured. We report the design, construction, and operational experience of the apparatus, as well as initial results.},

abstract = {A concept of interferometric measurements has been applied to the development of ultra-sensitive microwave noise measurement systems. These systems are capable of reaching a noise performance limited only by the thermal fluctuations in their lossy components. The noise floor of a real time microwave measurement system has been measured to be equal to -193 dBc/Hz at Fourier frequencies above 1 kHz. This performance is 40 dB better than that of conventional systems and has allowed the first experimental evidence of the intrinsic phase fluctuations in microwave isolators and circulators. Microwave frequency discriminators with interferometric signal processing have proved to be extremely effective for measuring and cancelling the phase noise in oscillators. This technique has allowed the design of X-band microwave oscillators with a phase noise spectral density of order -150 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz Fourier frequency, without the use of cryogenics. Another possible application of the interferometric noise measurements systems include {\&}ldquo;flicker noise-free{\&}rdquo; microwave amplifiers and advanced two oscillator noise measurement systems.},

Thus, it is appropriate for students who have learned the algebra of quantum theory. Where helpful, arguments are first given in a two-dimensional hilbert space.},

abstract = {Atomic vapor of four different paramagnetic species: gold, silver, lithium, and rubidium, is produced and studied inside several buffer gases: helium, nitrogen, neon, and argon. The paramagnetic atoms are injected into the buffer gas using laser ablation. Wires with diameters 25 mum, 50 mum, and 100 mum are used as ablation targets for gold and silver, bulk targets are used for lithium and rubidium. The buffer gas cools and confines the ablated atoms, slowing down their transport to the cell walls. Buffer gas temperatures between 20 K and 295 K, and densities between {\$}10 16 cm -3 and {\$}2times10 19 cm -3 are explored. Peak paramagnetic atom densities of {\$}10 11 cm -3 are routinely achieved. The longest observed paramagnetic vapor density decay times are 110 ms for silver at 20 K and 4 ms for lithium at 32 K. The candidates for the principal paramagnetic-atom loss mechanism are impurities in the buffer gas, dimer formation and atom loss on sputtered clusters.},

abstract = {Compared to purely atomic collisions, ultracold molecular collisions potentially support a much larger number of Fano-Feshbach resonances due to the enormous number of rovibrational states available. In fact, for alkali-metal dimers we find that the resulting density of resonances cannot be resolved at all, even on the sub-$\mu$K temperature scale of ultracold experiments. As a result, all observables become averaged over many resonances and can effectively be described by simpler, nonresonant scattering calculations. Two particular examples are discussed: nonchemically reactive RbCs and chemically reactive KRb. In the former case, the formation of a long-lived collision complex may lead to the ejection of molecules from a trap. In the latter case, chemical reactions broaden the resonances so much that they become unobservable.},

abstract = {Polar molecules are desirable systems for quantum simulations and cold chemistry. Molecular ions are easily trapped, but a bias electric field applied to polarize them tends to accelerate them out of the trap. We present a general solution to this issue by rotating the bias field slowly enough for the molecular polarization axis to follow but rapidly enough for the ions to stay trapped. We demonstrate Ramsey spectroscopy between Stark-Zeeman sublevels in (180)Hf(19)F(+) with a coherence time of 100 milliseconds. Frequency shifts arising from well-controlled topological (Berry) phases are used to determine magnetic g factors. The rotating-bias-field technique may enable using trapped polar molecules for precision measurement and quantum information science, including the search for an electron electric dipole moment.},

abstract = {We realize a quantum-gas microscope for fermionic 40Katoms trapped in an optical lattice, which allows one to probe strongly correlated fermions at the single-atom level. We combine 3D Raman sideband cooling with high-resolution optics to simultaneously cool and image individual atoms with single-lattice- site resolution at a detection fidelity above 95{\%}. The imaging process leaves the atoms predominantly in the 3D motional ground state of their respective lattice sites, inviting the implementation of a Maxwell's demon to assemble low-entropy many-body states. Single-site-resolved imaging of fermions enables the direct observation of magnetic order, time-resolved measurements of the spread of particle correlations, and the detection of many-fermion entanglement.},

@article{Bolotin2009,
abstract = {When electrons are confined in two dimensions and subject to strong magnetic fields, the Coulomb interactions between them can become very strong, leading to the formation of correlated states of matter, such as the fractional quantum Hall liquid. In this strong quantum regime, electrons and magnetic flux quanta bind to form complex composite quasiparticles with fractional electronic charge; these are manifest in transport measurements of the Hall conductivity as rational fractions of the elementary conductance quantum. The experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene has enabled the study of a correlated two-dimensional electronic system, in which the interacting electrons behave like massless chiral fermions. However, owing to the prevailing disorder, graphene has so far exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena, despite intense experimental and theoretical efforts. Here we report the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in ultraclean, suspended graphene. In addition, we show that at low carrier density graphene becomes an insulator with a magnetic-field-tunable energy gap. These newly discovered quantum states offer the opportunity to study correlated Dirac fermions in graphene in the presence of large magnetic fields.},

Motivated by significant recent progress in searches for an EDM-type signal in diatomic molecules with an uncompensated electron spin, we provide an estimate for the expected signal in the Standard Model due to the CKM phase.

abstract = {This is a theoretical review of exploration of new physics be yond the Standard Model (SM) in the electric dipole moment (EDM) in elementary parti cles, atoms and molecule. EDM is a very important CP violating phenomenon and sensitiv e to new physics. Start- ing with the estimations of EDM of quarks–leptons in SM, we ex plore new signals beyond SM. However, these works drive us to wider frontiers where we search fundamental physics using atoms and molecules and vice versa. Paramagne tic atoms and molecules have great enhancement factor on electron EDM. Diamagnetic atoms and molecules are very sensitive to nuclear P and T odd processes. Thus EDM becomes the keyword not only of New Physics but also of unprecedented fruitful colla borations among particle, atomic and molecular physics. This review intends to help such collaborations over a wide range of physicists},

Particular attention is paid to recent optical Keck/HIRES spectra of 49 absorption systems which indicate a smaller alpha in the past (Murphy et al. 2001, Webb et al. 2001). Here we present new preliminary results from 128 absorption systems: da/a = (-0.57 +/- 0.10) x 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}} over the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.7, in agreement with the previous results. Known potential systematic errors cannot explain these results. We compare them with strong `local' constraints and discuss other (radio and millimetre-wave) QSO absorption line constraints on variations in alpha{\^{}}2 * g{\_}p and alpha{\^{}}2 * g{\_}p * m{\_}e/m{\_}p (g{\_}p is the proton g-factor and m{\_}e/m{\_}p is the electron/proton mass ratio).

A similar technique for producing a diverse set of dense, ultracold diatomic molecular species will likewise transform the study of strongly interacting quantum systems, precision measurement, and physical chemistry. We demonstrate one- and two-dimensional transverse laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of the polar molecule yttrium (II) oxide (YO). Using a quasicycling optical transition we observe transverse Doppler cooling of a YO molecular beam to a temperature of 5 mK, limited by interaction time. With the addition of an oscillating magnetic quadrupole field we demonstrate a transverse magneto-optical trap and achieve temperatures of 2 mK.},

abstract = {Trapped atomic ions are standards for quantum information processing, serving as quantum memories, hosts of quantum gates in quantum computers and simulators, and nodes of quantum communication networks. Quantum bits based on trapped ions enjoy a rare combination of attributes: They have exquisite coherence properties, they can be prepared and measured with nearly 100{\%} efficiency, and they are readily entangled with each other through the Coulomb interaction or remote photonic interconnects. The outstanding challenge is the scaling of trapped ions to hundreds or thousands of qubits and beyond, at which scale quantum processors can outperform their classical counterparts in certain applications. We review the latest progress and prospects in that effort, with the promise of advanced architectures and new technologies, such as microfabricated ion traps and integrated photonics.},

Intensities of the sources as well as rovibrational energy distributions were analyzed. The molecular oxygen source was found to produce excessive amount of an unwanted BO(2) byproduct. Internal vibrational energy of boron monoxide generated in the water and methanol sources was too high to be considered for the study of dynamics of ground state radicals. The best combination of intensity, purity, and low internal energy was found in the carbon dioxide source to generate boron monoxide. We successfully tested the boron monoxide (BO; X(2)$\Sigma$(+)) radical beam source in crossed beams reactions with acetylene (C(2)H(2)) and ethylene (C(2)H(4)). The source was also compared with supersonic beams of the isoelectronic cyano (CN; X(2)$\Sigma$(+)) radical.},

We use narrowband depletion spectroscopy to probe the distribution of rotational levels formed in the {\$}X {\^{}}1\backslashSigma{\^{}}+(v=0){\$} state. We conclude, based on selection rules, that the primary decay route to {\$}X {\^{}}1\backslashSigma{\^{}}+(v=0){\$} is a two-step cascade decay that leads to as much as {\$}33\backslash{\%}{\$} branching into the {\$}J=0{\$} rotational level. The experimental simplicity of our scheme opens up the possibility of easier access to the study and manipulation of ultracold heteronuclear molecules in the rovibronic ground state.},

Bound-free 5(3)$\Pi$(0)(v, J) → 1(a)(3)$\Sigma$(+) emission has also been measured, and is used to determine the repulsive wall of the 1(a)(3)$\Sigma$(+) state and the 5(3)$\Pi$(0) → 1(a)(3)$\Sigma$(+) relative transition dipole moment function. Hyperfine structure in the 5(3)$\Pi$(0) state has not been observed in this experiment. This null result is explained using a simple vector coupling model.},

The lattice clock techniques also open a promising pathway toward trapped ultracold molecules and the possible precision measurement opportunities such molecules offer.},

abstract = {We report on a method of light-shift engineering where an auxiliary laser is used to tune the atomic transition frequency. The technique is used to selectively load a specific region of an optical lattice. The results are explained by calculating the differential light-shift of each hyperfine state. We conclude that the remarkable spatial selectivity of light-shift engineering using an auxiliary laser provides a powerful technique to prepare ultra-cold trapped atoms for experiments on quantum gases and quantum information processing.},

abstract = {A quantum simulator is a well-controlled quantum system that can follow the evolution of a prescribed model whose behaviour may be difficult to determine. A good example is the simulation of a set of interacting spins, where phase transitions between various spin orders can underlie poorly understood concepts such as spin liquids. Here we simulate the emergence of magnetism by implementing a fully connected non-uniform ferromagnetic quantum Ising model using up to 9 trapped (171)Yb(+) ions. By increasing the Ising coupling strengths compared with the transverse field, the crossover from paramagnetism to ferromagnetic order sharpens as the system is scaled up, prefacing the expected quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. We measure scalable order parameters appropriate for large systems, such as various moments of the magnetization. As the results are theoretically tractable, this work provides a critical benchmark for the simulation of intractable arbitrary fully connected Ising models in larger systems.},

abstract = {We have developed a way to mount ultra-high vacuum windows onto standard ConFlat({\textregistered}) vacuum systems with very low stress-induced birefringence. Each window is sealed to a stainless steel flange with a compressed indium wire, and that flange is connected to a vacuum chamber with another indium seal. We find that deformation of a standard ConFlat flange during indium sealing dominates the stress on the window, so an extra-rigid flange is needed for minimal birefringence. With this mounting scheme, the typical residual birefringence is $\Delta$n = 2.3 × 10(-7) and is unchanged by a 120 °C bake.},

abstract = {We investigate quantum control of a single atom in an optical tweezer trap created by a tightly focused optical beam. We show that longitudinal polarization components in the dipole trap arising from the breakdown of the paraxial approximation give rise to significant internal-state decoherence. We show that this effect can be mitigated by appropriate choice of magnetic bias field, enabling Raman sideband cooling of a single atom close to its three-dimensional ground state in an optical trap with a beam waist as small as {\$}w=900{\$} nm. We achieve vibrational occupation numbers of {\$}\backslashbar{\{}n{\}}{\_}r = 0.01{\$} and {\$}\backslashbar{\{}n{\}}{\_}a = 8{\$} in the radial and axial directions of the trap, corresponding to an rms size of the atomic wavepacket of 24 nm and 270 nm, respectively. This represents a promising starting point for future hybrid quantum systems where atoms are placed in close proximity to surfaces.},

@article{Jayich2014,
abstract = {Ultracold molecular gases are promising as an avenue to rich many-body physics, quantum chemistry, quantum information, and precision measurements. This richness, which flows from the complex internal structure of molecules, makes the creation of ultracold molecular gases using traditional methods (laser plus evaporative cooling) a challenge, in particular due to the spontaneous decay of molecules into dark states. We propose a way to circumvent this key bottleneck using an all-optical method for decelerating molecules using stimulated absorption and emission with a single ultrafast laser. We further describe single-photon cooling of the decelerating molecules that exploits their high dark state pumping rates, turning the principal obstacle to molecular laser cooling into an advantage. Cooling and deceleration may be applied simultaneously and continuously to load molecules into a trap. We discuss implementation details including multi-level numerical simulations of strontium monohydride (SrH). These techniques are applicable to a large number of molecular species and atoms with the only requirement being an electric dipole transition that can be accessed with an ultrafast laser.},

Recently, near quantum degenerate gases of molecules have been prepared in their rovibronic ground state. For future experiments, it is crucial to also control their hyperfine state. Here, we report the preparation of a rovibronic ground state molecular quantum gas in a single hyperfine state and in particular in the absolute lowest quantum state. The demonstrated and presented scheme is general for bialkali polar molecules and allows the preparation of molecules in a single hyperfine state or in an arbitrary coherent superposition of hyperfine states. The scheme relies on electric-dipole, two-photon microwave transitions through rotationally excited states and makes use of electric nuclear quadrupole interactions to transfer molecular population between different hyperfine states.},

abstract = {An improved measurement of the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) appears feasible using ground-state alkali atoms in an atomic fountain in which a strong electric field, which couples to a conceivable electron dipole moment (EDM), is applied perpendicular to the fountain axis. In a practical fountain, the ratio of the atomic tensor Stark shift to the Zeeman shift is a facto mu{\~{}}100. We expand the complete time evolution operator in inverse powers of this ratio; complete results are presented for atoms of total spin F=3, 4, and 5. For a specific set of entangled hyperfine sublevels (coherent states), potential systematic errors enter only as even powers of 1/mu, making the expansion rapidly convergent. The remaining EDM mimicking effects are further suppressed in a proposed double-differential setup, where the final state is interrogated in a differential laser configuration, and the direction of the strong electric field also is inverted. Estimates of the signal available at existing accelerator facilities indicate that the proposed apparatus offers the potential for a drastic improvement in EDM limits over existing measurements, and for constraining the parameter space of supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the Standard Model.},

abstract = {Neutral atoms stored in optical traps are strong candidates for a physical realization of a quantum logic device1, 2. Far off-resonance optical traps provide conservative potentials and excellent isolation from the environment, and they may be arranged to produce arbitrary arrays of traps, where each trap is occupied by a single atom that can be individually addressed3, 4, 5, 6. At present, significant effort is being expended on developing two-qubit gates based on coupling individual Rydberg atoms in adjacent optical microtraps7, 8, 9. A major challenge associated with this approach is the reliable generation of single-atom occupancy in each trap, as the loading efficiency in the past experiments has been limited to 50{\%} (refs 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12). Here we report a loading efficiency of 82.7{\%} in an optical microtrap. We achieve this by manipulating the collisions between pairs of trapped atoms through tailored optical fields and directly observing the resulting single atoms in the trap.},

@article{Yan2013,
abstract = {With the production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar interactions are expected to facilitate understanding of strongly interacting many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring quantum magnetism. In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions. Here we use dipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.},

abstract = {The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) can provide the correct neutralino relic abundance and baryon number asymmetry of the universe. Both may be efficiently generated in the presence of CP violating phases, light charginos and neutralinos, and a light top squark. Because of the coannihilation of the neutralino with the light stop, we find a large region of parameter space in which the neutralino relic density is consistent with WMAP and SDSS data. We perform a detailed study of the additional constraints induced when CP violating phases, consistent with the ones required for baryogenesis, are included. We explore the possible tests of this scenario from present and future electron electric dipole moment (EDM) measurements, direct neutralino detection experiments, collider searches and the b→s$\gamma$ decay rate. We find that the EDM constraints are quite severe and that electron EDM experiments, together with stop searches at the Tevatron and Higgs searches at the LHC, will provide a definite test of our scenario of electroweak baryogenesis in the next few years.},

abstract = {We use a string of confined {\$}{\^{}}{\{}40{\}}{\$}Ca{\$}{\^{}}+{\$} ions to measure perturbations to a trapping potential which are caused by light-induced charging of an anti-reflection coated window and of insulating patches on the ion-trap electrodes. The electric fields induced at the ions' position are characterised as a function of distance to the dielectric, and as a function of the incident optical power and wavelength. The measurement of the ion-string position is sensitive to as few as {\$}40{\$} elementary charges per {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}Hz{\}}{\}}{\$} on the dielectric at distances of order millimetres, and perturbations are observed for illumination with light of wavelengths as long as 729$\backslash$,nm. This has important implications for the future of miniaturised ion-trap experiments, notably with regards to the choice of electrode material, and the optics that must be integrated in the vicinity of the ion. The method presented can be readily applied to the investigation of charging effects beyond the context of ion trap experiments.},

The biases of the corrected and uncorrected methods are compared for the case of two estimates with both weights based on 10 degrees of freedom.

In particular, we detail the way experimental switches were used to suppress effects that can mimic the signal of interest.

@article{DeMille2004,
abstract = {We discuss the possibility of trapping polar molecules in the standing-wave electromagnetic field of a microwave resonant cavity. Such a trap has several novel features that make it very attractive for the development of ultracold molecule sources. Using commonly available technologies, microwave traps can be built with large depth (up to several Kelvin) and acceptance volume (up to several cm{\^{}}3), suitable for efficient loading with currently available sources of cold polar molecules. Unlike most previous traps for molecules, this technology can be used to confine the strong-field seeking absolute ground state of the molecule, in a free-space maximum of the microwave electric field. Such ground state molecules should be immune to inelastic collisional losses. We calculate elastic collision cross-sections for the trapped molecules, due to the electrical polarization of the molecules at the trap center, and find that they are extraordinarily large. Thus, molecules in a microwave trap should be very amenable to sympathetic and/or evaporative cooling. The combination of these properties seems to open a clear path to producing large samples of polar molecules at temperatures much lower than has been possible previously.},

@article{Rhee2009,
abstract = {Optical activity is the result of chiral molecules interacting differently with left versus right circularly polarized light. Because of this intrinsic link to molecular structure, the determination of optical activity through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has long served as a routine method for obtaining structural information about chemical and biological systems in condensed phases. A recent development is time-resolved CD spectroscopy, which can in principle map the structural changes associated with biomolecular function and thus lead to mechanistic insights into fundamental biological processes. But implementing time-resolved CD measurements is experimentally challenging because CD is a notoriously weak effect (a factor of 10(-4)-10(-6) smaller than absorption). In fact, this problem has so far prevented time-resolved vibrational CD experiments. Here we show that vibrational CD spectroscopy with femtosecond time resolution can be realized when using heterodyned spectral interferometry to detect the phase and amplitude of the infrared optical activity free-induction-decay field in time (much like in a pulsed NMR experiment). We show that we can detect extremely weak signals in the presence of large achiral background contributions, by simultaneously measuring with a femtosecond laser pulse the vibrational CD and optical rotatory dispersion spectra of dissolved chiral limonene molecules. We have so far only targeted molecules in equilibrium, but it would be straightforward to extend the method for the observation of ultrafast structural changes such as those occurring during protein folding or asymmetric chemical reactions. That is, we should now be in a position to produce 'molecular motion pictures' of fundamental molecular processes from a chiral perspective.},

abstract = {For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose–Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art ab initio techniques have been applied to compute the potential energy curves for the electronic states in the A(1)$\Sigma$(u)(+), c(3)$\Pi$(u), and a(3)$\Sigma$(u)(+) manifold of the strontium dimer, the spin-orbit and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements between the states in the manifold, and the electric transition dipole moment from the ground X(1)$\Sigma$(g)(+) to the nonrelativistic and relativistic states in the A+c+a manifold. The potential energy curves and transition moments were obtained with the linear response (equation of motion) coupled cluster method limited to single, double, and linear triple excitations for the potentials and limited to single and double excitations for the transition moments. The spin-orbit and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements were computed with the multireference configuration interaction method limited to single and double excitations. Our results for the nonrelativistic and relativistic (spin-orbit coupled) potentials deviate substantially from recent ab initio calculations. The potential energy curve for the spectroscopically active (1)0(u)(+) state is in quantitative agreement with the empirical potential fitted to high-resolution Fourier transform spectra [A. Stein, H. Knöckel, and E. Tiemann, Eur. Phys. J. D 64, 227 (2011)]. The computed ab initio points were fitted to physically sound analytical expressions, and used in converged coupled channel calculations of the rovibrational energy levels in the A+c+a manifold and line strengths for the A(1)$\Sigma$(u)(+)←X(1)$\Sigma$(g (+) transitions. Positions and lifetimes of quasi-bound Feshbach resonances lying above the (1)S(0) + (3)P(1) dissociation limit were also obtained. Our results reproduce (semi)quantitatively the experimental data observed thus far. Predictions for on-going and future experiments are also reported.},

This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

abstract = {Magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances were employed to associate cold diatomic molecules in a series of experiments involving both atomic Bose as well as two spin component Fermi gases. This review illustrates theoretical concepts of both the particular nature of the highly excited Feshbach molecules produced and the techniques for their association from unbound atom pairs. Coupled channels theory provides the rigorous formulation of the microscopic physics of Feshbach resonances in cold gases. Concepts of dressed versus bare energy states, universal properties of Feshbach molecules, as well as the classification in terms of entrance- and closed-channel dominated resonances are introduced on the basis of practical two-channel approaches. Their significance is illustrated for several experimental observations, such as binding energies and lifetimes with respect to collisional relaxation. Molecular association and dissociation are discussed in the context of techniques involving linear magnetic field sweeps in cold Bose and Fermi gases as well as pulse sequences leading to Ramsey-type interference fringes. Their descriptions in terms of Landau-Zener, two-level mean field as well as beyond mean field approaches are reviewed in detail, including the associated ranges of validity.},

abstract = {Heavy diatomic molecules have been identified as good candidates for use in electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) searches. Suitable molecular species can be produced in pulsed beams, but with a total flux and/or temporal evolution that varies significantly from pulse to pulse. These variations can degrade the experimental sensitivity to changes in spin precession phase of an electri- cally polarized state, which is the observable of interest for an eEDM measurement. We present two methods for measurement of the phase that provide immunity to beam temporal variations, and make it possible to reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. Each method employs rapid projection of the spin state onto both components of an orthonormal basis. We demonstrate both methods using the eEDM-sensitive H state of thorium monoxide (ThO), and use one of them to measure the magnetic moment of this state with increased accuracy relative to previous determinations.},

@article{Islam2013,
abstract = {Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network, is often responsible for the emergent complexity of many-body systems. For instance, frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses, and spin ices, whose ground states can be massively degenerate and carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. Here, we engineer frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions between spins stored in a crystal of up to 16 trapped (171)Yb(+) atoms. We control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their coherent dynamics. This prototypical quantum simulation points the way toward a new probe of frustrated quantum magnetism and perhaps the design of new quantum materials.},

@article{Graham2013,
abstract = {We propose new signals for the direct detection of ultralight dark matter such as the axion. Axion or axion like particle (ALP) dark matter may be thought of as a background, classical field. We consider couplings for this field which give rise to observable effects including a nuclear electric dipole moment, and axial nucleon and electron moments. These moments oscillate rapidly with frequencies accessible in the laboratory, {\~{}} kHz to GHz, given by the dark matter mass. Thus, in contrast to WIMP detection, instead of searching for the hard scattering of a single dark matter particle, we are searching for the coherent effects of the entire classical dark matter field. We calculate current bounds on such time varying moments and consider a technique utilizing NMR methods to search for the induced spin precession. The parameter space probed by these techniques is well beyond current astrophysical limits and significantly extends laboratory probes. Spin precession is one way to search for these ultralight particles, but there may well be many new types of experiments that can search for dark matter using such time-varying moments.},

Whereas commensurate lattice fillings result in gapped phases with bond-order and/or density-wave order, at incommensurate fillings we find chiral-, two-component-, and pair-superfluids. We show as well that, remarkably, polar molecules in frustrated lattices allow, for the first time to our knowledge, for the observation of bond-ordered supersolids.},

The dependence of LaOMn+ yield on the laser fluence also confirmed the formation of the ionic hypermetallic species. Theoretical calculations were carried out to predict the stability and the geometric structures of these new molecules. The calculations suggest that the LaOMn and LaOMn+ molecules might be formed via secondary reactions of the neutral and ionic MnO with La or La+ in the laser ablated plasma.

By applying Rabi, Ramsey, and spin-echo techniques, we systematically investigate the dephasing mechanisms and determine the coherence time. Simultaneous Ramsey measurements in up to 16 dipole traps are performed and proves the scalability of our approach. This represents an important step in the application of scalable registers of atomic qubits for quantum information processing. In addition, this system can serve as the basis for novel atomic clocks making use of the parallel operation of a large number of individual clocks each remaining separately addressable.},

abstract = {A pulsed valve connected to a closed-cycle cryostat was optimized for producing helium droplets. The pulsed droplet beam appeared with a bimodal size distribution. The leading part of the pulse consists of droplets suitable for doping with molecules. The average size of this part can be varied between 10(4) and 10(6) helium atoms, and the width of the distribution is smaller as compared to a continuous-flow droplet source. The system has been tested in a single pulse mode and at repetition rates of up to 500 Hz with almost constant intensity. The droplet density was found to be increased by more than an order of magnitude as compared to a continuous-flow droplet source.},

@article{Frisch2013,
abstract = {Atomic and molecular samples reduced to temperatures below 1 microkelvin, yet still in the gas phase, afford unprecedented energy resolution in probing and manipulating how their constituent particles interact with one another. For simple atoms, such as alkalis, scattering resonances are extremely well-characterized. However, ultracold physics is now poised to enter a new regime, where far more complex species can be cooled and studied, including magnetic lanthanide atoms and even molecules. For molecules, it has been speculated that a dense forest of resonances in ultracold collision cross sections will likely express essentially random fluctuations, much as the observed energy spectra of nuclear scattering do. According to the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture, these fluctuations would imply chaotic dynamics of the underlying classical motion driving the collision. This would provide a paradigm shift in ultracold atomic and molecular physics, necessitating new ways of looking at the fundamental interactions of atoms in this regime, as well as perhaps new chaos-driven states of ultracold matter. In this report we provide the first experimental demonstration that random spectra are indeed found at ultralow temperatures. In the experiment, an ultracold gas of erbium atoms is shown to exhibit many Fano-Feshbach resonances, for bosons on the order of 3 per gauss. Analysis of their statistics verifies that their distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings is what one would expect from random matrix theory. The density and statistics of these resonances are explained by fully-quantum mechanical scattering calculations that locate their origin in the anisotropy of the atoms' potential energy surface. Our results therefore reveal for the first time chaotic behavior in the native interaction between ultracold atoms.},

The nozzle flow rate Nn is calculated, and the peaking factor $\kappa$ is determined from both radial pressure surveys and effusive‐to‐supersonic transition measurements. Stage pressure measurements verify both Nn and $\kappa$. These quantities specify the ideal beam flux in the absence of attenuation, interference, or condensation. Background attentuation depends on the effective scattering cross section, which can be quite large for finely collimated beams. Serious skimmer interference occurs below a critical value of the skimmer Knudsen number and depends on individual skimmer details. Condensation is observed and found to be predictable according to the known scaling laws. A calculation of absolute beam fluxes is presented. Nonideal behavior of the speed ratio and average particle velocity are also examined. Data are given for the gases H2, He, Ne, and Ar.},

We report the frequency ratio of two optical atomic clocks with a fractional uncertainty of 5.2 x 10(-17). The ratio of aluminum and mercury single-ion optical clock frequencies nuAl+/nuHg+ is 1.052871833148990438(55), where the uncertainty comprises a statistical measurement uncertainty of 4.3 x 10(-17), and systematic uncertainties of 1.9 x 10(-17) and 2.3 x 10(-17) in the mercury and aluminum frequency standards, respectively.

@article{Campargue1984,
abstract = {Various improvements are described for producing free jets and nozzle beams without complex formation. It is shown that our approach, based on the creation of a free-jet zone of silence unaffected by the background gas at relatively high pressure (PI N lo-' to 1 torr), is very efficient for improving the practical performance limited by the pumping means in the conventional method (PI 5 torr). The skimmer interference problem is found to be relatively simple at low ambient pressure but very difficult under our usual conditions where the free-jet shock wave structure is well formed. However, this difficulty is now conveniently solved and the zone of silence appears as an ideal medium for supercooling pure or seeded light gases expanded through miniature capillary nozzles (10-100 pm in diameter) operated at very high pressure (up to 200 bar) even at low temperature (down to 80 K). The limitations due to condensation, for most of the gases, are avoided by using high-temperature, high-pressure sources. Furthermore, skimming is greatly simplified by increasing the particle energy by heating and/or seeding, as also observed with clustering. The most interesting characteristics obtained for a He beam are as follows: speed ratios SI, N 350, corresponding to velocity spreads of OS{\%}, energy resolutions of 0.6 meV, and translational temperatures Til N 6 X K. The kinetic energy range from lo-' to about 40 eV can be covered by the heating and seeding techniques. Results obtained for He-Ar and He-Xe mixtures in time-of-flight experiments are well confirmed theoretically by the method of moments of the Boltzmann equation. Finally, fluorescence measurements on heated CO free-jets find more or less complete rotational relaxation and vibrational freezing close to the nozzle throat, for instance at 2000 K with the source operated at 2500 K.},

abstract = {Single-atom-resolved detection in optical lattices using quantum-gas microscopes has enabled a new generation of experiments in the field of quantum simulation. Fluorescence imaging of individual atoms has so far been achieved for bosonic species with optical molasses cooling, whereas detection of fermionic alkaline atoms in optical lattices by this method has proven more challenging. Here we demonstrate single-site- and single-atom-resolved fluorescence imaging of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in a quantum-gas microscope setup using electromagnetically-induced-transparency cooling. We detected on average 1000 fluorescence photons from a single atom within 1.5s, while keeping it close to the vibrational ground state of the optical lattice. Our results will enable the study of strongly correlated fermionic quantum systems in optical lattices with resolution at the single-atom level, and give access to observables such as the local entropy distribution and individual defects in fermionic Mott insulators or anti-ferromagnetically ordered phases.},

@article{Madey1998,
abstract = {This paper begins with a brief survey of the literature dealing with the$\backslash$nadsorption and desorption of alkalis on oxide surfaces. Emphasis is on$\backslash$ndesorption phenomena: thermal desorption, electron- and$\backslash$nphoton-stimulated desorption, and ion-induced desorption (sputtering).$\backslash$nThen the relevance of these data to the desorption of alkalis from$\backslash$nmineral surfaces and to the origins of alkali vapors in tenuous$\backslash$nplanetary atmospheres is discussed. The data presented for Na and K$\backslash$nindicate that desorption processes initiated by thermal or electronic$\backslash$nexcitations do not depend strongly on whether the Na returns to the$\backslash$nsurface or diffuses up through the regolith, and that neutral yields$\backslash$ndominate ion yields in all cases. Although the desorbed neutral energy$\backslash$ndistributions are not well approximated by Maxwell-Boltzmann$\backslash$ndistributions, the mean energies of the desorbed neutral Na and K are$\backslash$nseen to be consistent with the temperatures extracted for the ``hot{\{}''{\}}$\backslash$ncomponent of the lunar atmosphere. This suggests that the ``hot{\{}''{\}}$\backslash$ncomponent may be produced by electronically stimulated desorption (e.g.,$\backslash$nelectron-stimulated desorption and/or photon-stimulated desorption). If$\backslash$nthis is the case, a possible ``size effect{\{}''{\}} may be operative, in$\backslash$nwhich desorbed neutral K atoms are somewhat more energetic than desorbed$\backslash$nNa. In such desorption processes a low-energy component may be generated$\backslash$nby scattering of desorbing atoms in the porous regolith; thermal$\backslash$ndesorption can also generate low-energy atoms. The data further indicate$\backslash$nthat thermal desorption should be rapid in the equatorial regions of$\backslash$nMercury, possibly depleting this region of alkalis, whereas thermal$\backslash$ndesorption should be less efficient on the Moan. Surface charging may be$\backslash$nimportant at the surface of the Moon, by accelerating the solar$\backslash$nelectrons to energies above the threshold for initiating alkali$\backslash$ndesorption. Suggestions are made for future laboratory work.},

The molecular structure indicates a linear equilibrium structure with the H(D) atom between the Kr and Cl atoms. However, the inverse moments of inertia measured here indicate large amplitude vibrations of the H(D) atom relative to the Kr–Cl internuclear line. Estimates of the Kr–Cl stretching frequency and force constants, which show considerable dependence on the isotopic species, are also given. Bending frequencies and force constants are also given.},

abstract = {We calculate the proton and neutron spin contributions for nuclei using semi-empirical methods, as well as a novel hybrid $\backslash$emph{\{}ab initio{\}}/semi-empirical method, for interpretation of experimental data. We demonstrate that core-polarisation corrections to $\backslash$emph{\{}ab initio{\}} nuclear shell model calculations generally reduce discrepancies in proton and neutron spin expectation values from different calculations. We derive constraints on the spin-dependent P,T-violating interaction of a bound proton with nucleons, which for certain ranges of exchanged pseudoscalar boson masses improve on the most stringent laboratory limits by several orders of magnitude. We derive a limit on the CPT and Lorentz-invariance-violating parameter {\$}|\backslashtilde{\{}b{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashperp{\}}{\^{}}p| {\textless} 7.6 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-33{\}}{\$} GeV, which improves on the most stringent existing limit by a factor of 8, and demonstrate sensitivities to the parameters {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}d{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashperp{\}}{\^{}}p{\$} and {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}g{\}}{\_}{\{} D\backslashperp{\}}{\^{}}p{\$} at the level {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-29{\}} - 10{\^{}}{\{}-28{\}}{\$} GeV, which is a one order of magnitude improvement compared to the corresponding existing sensitivities.

The trapped atoms undergoing microwave Rabi oscillations are sensitive to a small signal, artificially generated with a second microwave source, phase locked to the first allowing a simple and effective method for determining signal-to-noise ratio limits through interference techniques. This provides an excellent means of calibrating sensitivity in experiments such as our ongoing Fr parity non-conservation measurement.},

@article{Schneider2012,
abstract = {Direct experimental access to some of the most intriguing quantum phenomena is not granted due to the lack of precise control of the relevant parameters in their naturally intricate environment. Their simulation on conventional computers is impossible, since quantum behaviour arising with superposition states or entanglement is not efficiently translatable into the classical language. However, one could gain deeper insight into complex quantum dynamics by experimentally simulating the quantum behaviour of interest in another quantum system, where the relevant parameters and interactions can be controlled and robust effects detected sufficiently well. Systems of trapped ions provide unique control of both the internal (electronic) and external (motional) degrees of freedom. The mutual Coulomb interaction between the ions allows for large interaction strengths at comparatively large mutual ion distances enabling individual control and readout. Systems of trapped ions therefore exhibit a prominent system in several physical disciplines, for example, quantum information processing or metrology. Here, we will give an overview of different trapping techniques of ions as well as implementations for coherent manipulation of their quantum states and discuss the related theoretical basics. We then report on the experimental and theoretical progress in simulating quantum many-body physics with trapped ions and present current approaches for scaling up to more ions and more-dimensional systems.},

A collisionally cooled cryogenic atomic source with average forward velocity of 60-70 m/s and a width of {\~{}}70 m/s allows for loading without additional dissipation, unlike oven or supersonic sources. The lanthanides Yb, Tm, Er, and Ho are trapped. Despite the He buffer-gas background, we observe a maximum lifetime of about 80 ms (with Yb). We further show that the addition of a single-frequency slowing laser increases the number of trapped Yb atoms by an order of magnitude, yielding a total of 4.0(2) x 10{\^{}}8. We study decay to metastable states in all species and report decay rates. Extension of this approach to MOTs of molecules is discussed.},

The light-pressure force on the atom as given by a simple two-level theory is recovered in the absence of polarization gradients, whereas a spatial variation of the polarization is found to lead to a strong cooling force for slow atoms. The increased cooling force is responsible for the recent observations of atoms cooled in optical molasses to temperatures an order of magnitude below the Doppler limit.},

abstract = {We present a first implementation of optical-frequency-comb-based rapid trace gas detection in the molecular fingerprint region in the mid-infrared. Near-real-time acquisition of broadband absorption spectra with 0.0056 cm(-1) maximum resolution is demonstrated using a frequency comb Fourier transform spectrometer which operates in the 2100-to-3700-cm(-1) spectral region. We achieve part-per-billion detection limits in 30 seconds of integration time for several important molecules including methane, ethane, isoprene, and nitrous oxide. Our system enables precise concentration measurements even in gas mixtures that exhibit continuous absorption bands, and it allows detection of molecules at levels below the noise floor via simultaneous analysis of multiple spectral features.},

abstract = {We report on the performance of the third-order Douglas-Kroll ab initio model potential (DK3-AIMP) method-based electron-correlated spin-orbit calculations. Our treatment assumes that the problem can be separated into a spin-free correlation treatment and a spin-orbit calculation. The correlation effects were calculated using the multistate complete active space second-order perturbation method, and the spin-orbit effects were treated by means of the restricted active space state interaction spin-orbit method, where the spin-orbit effects were approximated by the Douglas-Kroll type of atomic mean-field spin-orbit method. We used our method for illustrative calculations on the ground and low-lying electronic states of thorium monoxide. For a proper description of the inner core region in the spin-orbit calculations, an auxiliary spin-orbit basis set was introduced. The DK3-AIMP-based electron-correlated spin-orbit calculations on ThO yield good agreement with corresponding all-electron results and with the available experimental data. This confirms that the DK3-AIMP method can be easily combined with highly accurate correlation treatments and relativistic effects, both of which are vital for studying the actinides. To our knowledge, the literature contains no references to AIMP calculations on the low-lying states of ThO. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

The effective interaction length between light and matter is increased by the cavity, massively enhancing the sensitivity for measurement of optical losses. Individual comb components act as independent detection channels across a broad spectral window, providing rapid parallel processing. In this review we discuss the principles, the technology, and the first applications that demonstrate the enormous potential of this spectroscopic method. In particular, we describe various frequency comb sources, techniques for efficient coupling between comb and cavity, and detection schemes that utilize the technique's high-resolution, wide-bandwidth, and fast data-acquisition capabilities. We discuss a range of applications, including breath analysis for medical diagnosis, trace-impurity detection in specialty gases, and characterization of a supersonic jet of cold molecules.},

We also show theoretically that a comparison of these values with electric-field-induced birefringence (Kerr) data can determine uniquely the fractional contribution to both of purely electronic nonlinearities. Existing Kerr data are only accurate enough at present for us to conclude that the electronic nonlinearities might dominate our effect.},

abstract = {The emission spectra of TaN have been investigated in the region 3000-35 000 cm(-1) using a Fourier transform spectrometer. The spectra were observed in a tantalum hollow-cathode lamp by discharging a mixture of 1.5 Torr of Ne and about 6 mTorr of N-2. In addition to previously known bands, numerous additional bands were observed and assigned to a number of new transitions. The spectroscopic properties of the low-lying electronic states of TaN were also predicted by ab initio calculations. A E-1(+) state, with equilibrium constants of B-e = 0.457 852 1(48) cm(-1) alpha(e) = 0.002 235 9(67) cm(-1), and R-e = 1.683 099 9(88) Angstrom, has been identified as the ground state of TaN based on our experimental observations supported by the ab initio results. The first excited state has been identified as the a(3)Delta(1) spin component at 2827 cm(-1) above the ground state. To higher energies, the states become difficult to assign because of their Hund's case (c) behavior and extensive interactions between the spin components of the electronic terms.

abstract = {Ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide a versatile tool with which to investigate fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems. In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the first cavity-enhanced optical frequency comb spectroscopy in the mid-infrared wavelength region and report the sensitive real-time trace detection of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a large amount of water. The experimental apparatus is based on a mid-infrared optical parametric oscillator synchronously pumped by a high-power Yb:fiber laser, a high-finesse broadband cavity, and a fast-scanning Fourier transform spectrometer with autobalancing detection. The comb spectrum with a bandwidth of 200 nm centered around 3.76 mu m is simultaneously coupled to the cavity and both degrees of freedom of the comb, i.e. the repetition rate and carrier envelope offset frequency, are locked to the cavity to ensure stable transmission. The autobalancing detection scheme reduces the intensity noise by a factor of 300, and a sensitivity of 5.4x10(-9) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) with a resolution of 800 MHz is achieved (corresponding to 6.9x10(-11) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) per spectral element for 6000 resolved elements). This yields a noise equivalent detection limit for hydrogen peroxide of 8 parts-per-billion (ppb); in the presence of 2.8 {\%} of water the detection limit is 130 ppb. Spectra of acetylene, methane, and nitrous oxide at atmospheric pressure are also presented, and a line-shape model is developed to simulate the experimental data.},

@article{Gerritsma2010,
abstract = {The Dirac equation is a cornerstone in the history of physics, merging successfully quantum mechanics with special relativity, providing a natural description of the electron spin and predicting the existence of anti-matter. Furthermore, it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm, relativistic quantum mechanics, is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein's paradox and Zitterbewegung, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr$\backslash$"odinger. These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles, while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects. Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups, where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes. Here, we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion, which is set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the cross-over from relativistic to nonrelativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for making ultracold molecules below 300 {\{}mK{\}} by cooling via the dipole force of an intense infrared {\{}(IR){\}} standing wave created in a high finesse cavity. Deceleration can be achieved by periodically switching an {\{}IR{\}} standing wave slightly red-detuned from the resonance frequency of a molecular vibration-rotation transition. The potential depth becomes as high as 50 {\{}mK{\}} with an incident laser power of 3 W. By properly switching the potential, one can remove the translational energy of molecules from a couple of hundred {\{}mK{\}} to 300 {\{}mK{\}} or below. Since all molecules except homonuclear diatomic molecules have one or more optical transitions in the {\{}IR{\}} range that can be used for a source of the dipole force, the present method is applicable to almost all molecules of chemical interest. Moreover, by choosing an appropriate rotation-vibration transition, one can decelerate and trap molecules in the completely ground state in any degrees of freedom. Numerical simulations showed sufficiently wide phase-space areas of decelerated molecules through use of this technique for practical applications. The effect of various parameters on the efficiency of the cavity decelerator has been examined by numerical simulations.},

Changes in absorption above the noise floor of 5×10(-4) are readily detected on the millisecond time scale, leading to important future applications such as real-time monitoring of trace gas concentrations and detection of reactive intermediates.},

A blind analysis avoids the possibility of experimenters biasing their result toward their own preconceptions by preventing them from knowing the answer until the analysis is complete. There is at least circumstantial evidence that such a bias has affected past measurements, and as experiments have become costlier and more difficult and hence harder to reproduce, the possibility of bias has become a more important issue than in the past. We describe here the motivations for performing a blind analysis, and give several modern examples of successful blind analysis strategies.},

abstract = {The ability to manipulate individual atoms, ions or photons allows controlled engineering of the quantum state of small sets of trapped particles; this is necessary to encode and process information at the quantum level. Recent achievements in this direction have used either trapped ions or trapped photons in cavity quantum-electrodynamical systems. A third possibility that has been studied theoretically is to use trapped neutral atoms. Such schemes would benefit greatly from the ability to trap and address individual atoms with high spatial resolution. Here we demonstrate a method for loading and detecting individual atoms in an optical dipole trap of submicrometre size. Because of the extremely small trapping volume, only one atom can be loaded at a time, so that the statistics of the number of atoms in the trap, N, are strongly sub-poissonian (DeltaN2 approximately 0.5N). We present a simple model for describing the observed behaviour, and we discuss the possibilities for trapping and addressing several atoms in separate traps, for applications in quantum information processing.},

@article{Hudson2011,
abstract = {The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric, with a distortion characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), d(e). No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 ± 5.7(stat) ± 1.5(syst)) × 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| {\textless} 10.5 × 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero, indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy scale.},

Can simple quantum mechanical rules such as quantum statistics, single partial-wave scattering, and quantum threshold laws provide a clear understanding of the molecular reactivity under a vanishing collision energy? Starting with an optically trapped near-quantum-degenerate gas of polar 40K87Rb molecules prepared in their absolute ground state, we report experimental evidence for exothermic atom-exchange chemical reactions. When these fermionic molecules were prepared in a single quantum state at a temperature of a few hundred nanokelvin, we observed p-wave-dominated quantum threshold collisions arising from tunneling through an angular momentum barrier followed by a short-range chemical reaction with a probability near unity. When these molecules were prepared in two different internal states or when molecules and atoms were brought together, the reaction rates were enhanced by a factor of 10 to 100 as a result of s-wave scattering, which does not have a centrifugal barrier. The measured rates agree with predicted universal loss rates related to the two-body van der Waals length.},

Variational calculations of rovibrational energy levels show that the (4)He-ThO van der Waals complex has a binding energy of 10.9 cm(-1) in its ground J = 0 rotational state. The calculated energy levels are used to obtain the temperature dependence of the chemical equilibrium constant for the formation of the He-ThO complex. We find that complex formation is thermodynamically favored at temperatures below 1 K and predict the maximum abundance of free ground-state ThO(v = 0, j = 0) molecules between 2 and 3 K. The calculated cross sections for momentum transfer in elastic He + ThO collisions display a rich resonance structure below 5 cm(-1) and decline monotonically above this collision energy. The cross sections for rotational relaxation accompanied by momentum transfer decline abruptly to zero at low collision energies ({\textless}0.1 cm(-1)). We find that Stark relaxation in He + ThO collisions can be enhanced by applying an external dc electric field of less than 100 kV∕cm. Finally, we present calculations of thermally averaged diffusion cross sections for ThO in He gas, and find these to be insensitive to small variations of the PES at temperatures above 1 K.},

By working in a regime where the single-atom Rabi frequency of the laser used for excitation to the Rydberg state is comparable to the interaction energy, we observe a $\backslash$emph{\{}partial{\}} Rydberg blockade, whereby the time-dependent populations of the various two-atom states exhibit coherent oscillations with several frequencies. A quantitative comparison of the data with a simple model based on the optical Bloch equations allows us to extract the van der Waals energy, and to observe its characteristic {\$}C{\_}6/R{\^{}}6{\$} dependence. The magnitude of the measured {\$}C{\_}6{\$} coefficient agrees well with an $\backslash$emph{\{}ab-initio{\}} theoretical calculation, and we observe its dramatic increase with the principal quantum number {\$}n{\$} of the Rydberg state. Our results not only allow to test an important physical law, but also demonstrate a degree of experimental control which opens new perspectives in quantum information processing and quantum simulation using long-range interactions between the atoms.},

@article{Zhang2005,
abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron-hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction--a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

A short historical summary of the development of high resolution interferometric Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers is given and the possibilities of the currently most highly resolving FTIR spectrometer, which is commercially available in the Bruker IFS 125 series, are discussed. The computational tools necessary to analyse FTIR spectra are described briefly. As examples of rovibrational analysis the spectra of three selected molecules CHCl(2)F, CDBrClF, and pyridine (C(5)H(5)N) are discussed. The spectrum of CHCl(2)F, a fluorochlorohydrocarbon, is of interest for a better understanding of the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. CDBrClF is a chiral molecule and therefore the analysis of its rovibrational spectra provides the basis for carrying out further experiments towards the detection of molecular parity violation. The analysis of the pyridine FTIR spectra illustrates the potential of the new generation of FTIR spectrometers in the study of spectra and rovibrational dynamics of aromatic systems and molecules of potential biological interest.},

abstract = {The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger-scale, strongly correlated quantum systems in order to record in situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near-zero entropy and clearly resolve the high-entropy rings separating them, even though their width is of the order of just a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts with increasing temperature, owing to a proliferation of local defects. The ability to resolve individual lattice sites directly opens up new avenues for the manipulation, analysis and applications of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice. For example, one could introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes.},

Under typical conditions we produce a beam of brightness 1.2 × 10(11) molecules/sr/pulse in the X(2)$\Sigma$(+)(v = 0, N(rot) = 0) state, with 140(m/s) forward velocity and a rotational temperature of ≈ 1 K.

From these values the transition dipole moments for visible bands are determined. Vibrational spacing in the X1??+ state and the spin-orbit splitting of the a3?? state are measured and compared with predicted values. The dispersed fluorescence spectra and determined branching ratios reveal that the most effective mechanism for populating the a3??1(J=1,v=0) state, which will be used in future P- and T-violation measurements, is via excitation of the [18.42]0+ ???

abstract = {We present experiments on decelerating and trapping ammonia molecules using a combination of a Stark decelerator and a traveling wave decelerator. In the traveling wave decelerator, a moving potential is created by a series of ring-shaped electrodes to which oscillating high voltages (HV) are applied. By lowering the frequency of the applied voltages, the molecules confined in the moving trap are decelerated and brought to a standstill. As the molecules are confined in a true 3D well, this kind of deceleration has practically no losses, resulting in a great improvement on the usual Stark deceleration techniques. The necessary voltages are generated by amplifying the output of an arbitrary wave generator using fast HV amplifiers, giving us great control over the trapped molecules. We illustrate this by experiments in which we adiabatically cool trapped NH3 and ND3 molecules and resonantly excite their motion.},

This frequency shift arises from the presence of electric charges trapped on dielectric surfaces placed under vacuum close to the atomic sample. We show that these charges can be eliminated by shining UV light on the dielectric surfaces, and characterize the residual dc Stark frequency shift on the clock transition at the {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}-18{\}}{\$} level by applying an external electric field. This study shows that the dc Stark shift can play an important role in the accuracy budget of lattice clocks, and should be duly taken into account.},

abstract = {Electric field noise is a hinderance to the assembly of large-scale quantum computers based on entangled trapped ions. Apart from ubiquitous technical noise, experimental studies of trapped ion heating have revealed additional limiting contributions to this noise, originating from atomic processes on the electrode surfaces. In a recent work [Safavi-Naini, Rabl, Weck, and Sadeghpour, Phys. Rev. A 84, 023412 (2011)] we described a microscopic model for this excess electric field noise, which points away towards a more systematic understanding of surface adsorbates as progenitors of electric field jitter noise. Here, we address the impact of surface monolayer contamination on adsorbate-induced noise processes. Using exact numerical calculations for H and N atomic monolayers on a Au(111) surface, representing opposite extremes of physisorption and chemisorption, we show that an additional monolayer can significantly affect the noise power spectrum and, respectively, enhance and suppress the heating rates.

@article{Brixner2005,
abstract = {Time-resolved optical spectroscopy is widely used to study vibrational and electronic dynamics by monitoring transient changes in excited state populations on a femtosecond timescale. Yet the fundamental cause of electronic and vibrational dynamics--the coupling between the different energy levels involved--is usually inferred only indirectly. Two-dimensional femtosecond infrared spectroscopy based on the heterodyne detection of three-pulse photon echoes has recently allowed the direct mapping of vibrational couplings, yielding transient structural information. Here we extend the approach to the visible range and directly measure electronic couplings in a molecular complex, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic light-harvesting protein. As in all photosynthetic systems, the conversion of light into chemical energy is driven by electronic couplings that ensure the efficient transport of energy from light-capturing antenna pigments to the reaction centre. We monitor this process as a function of time and frequency and show that excitation energy does not simply cascade stepwise down the energy ladder. We find instead distinct energy transport pathways that depend sensitively on the detailed spatial properties of the delocalized excited-state wavefunctions of the whole pigment-protein complex.},

abstract = {Understanding exotic forms of magnetism in quantum mechanical systems is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics, with implications for systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to spintronic devices. Simulating magnetic materials in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition is computationally intractable on classical computers, owing to the extreme complexity arising from quantum entanglement between the constituent magnetic spins. Here we use a degenerate Bose gas of rubidium atoms confined in an optical lattice to simulate a chain of interacting quantum Ising spins as they undergo a phase transition. Strong spin interactions are achieved through a site-occupation to pseudo-spin mapping. As we vary a magnetic field, quantum fluctuations drive a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase into an antiferromagnetic phase. In the paramagnetic phase, the interaction between the spins is overwhelmed by the applied field, which aligns the spins. In the antiferromagnetic phase, the interaction dominates and produces staggered magnetic ordering. Magnetic domain formation is observed through both in situ site-resolved imaging and noise correlation measurements. By demonstrating a route to quantum magnetism in an optical lattice, this work should facilitate further investigations of magnetic models using ultracold atoms, thereby improving our understanding of real magnetic materials.},

abstract = {Ultracold polar molecules offer the possibility of exploring quantum gases with interparticle interactions that are strong, long-range and spatially anisotropic. This is in stark contrast to the much studied dilute gases of ultracold atoms, which have isotropic and extremely short-range (or 'contact') interactions. Furthermore, the large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned using an external electric field; this has a range of applications such as the control of ultracold chemical reactions, the design of a platform for quantum information processing and the realization of novel quantum many-body systems. Despite intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules, only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here we report the experimental observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a pronounced increase in the loss rate of fermionic potassium-rubidium molecules due to ultracold chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be understood in a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for the scattering of fermionic polar molecules. In addition, we directly observe the spatial anisotropy of the dipolar interaction through measurements of the thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction rates in an ultracold gas of polar molecules. Furthermore, the large loss rates in an applied electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to suppress the influence of the attractive, 'head-to-tail', dipolar interactions.},

We investigate the impact of the cooling process on the rotational state distribution of the vibrational ground state, and observe that an initial distribution, J(initial)=0-2 is only moderately affected resulting in J(final)=0-4.

We apply this method to perform resolved sideband cooling to the two-dimensional vibrational ground state and to coherently manipulate the atomic motion. The presented scheme requires minimal additional resources and can be applied to experiments with challenging optical access, as we demonstrate by our implementation for atoms strongly coupled to an optical cavity.},

abstract = {We report the first observation of subrecoil laser cooling in three dimensions, where we use the method of velocity-selective coherent population trapping. We have cooled a cloud of trapped metastable helium atoms to 180 nK, 22 times below the single-photon recoil temperature, with an enhancement in the momentum-space density of 16. We find that the efficiency with which the velocity-selective trap is populated can be augmented by Sisyphus-type frictional forces, while the cooling process is accompanied by the diffusion of atoms to states of very high velocity.},

@article{Brown2008,
abstract = {Designs for a broadband chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectrometer are presented. The spectrometer is capable of measuring the 7-18 GHz region of a rotational spectrum in a single data acquisition. One design uses a 4.2 Gsampless arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to produce a 1 mus duration chirped pulse with a linear frequency sweep of 1.375 GHz. This pulse is sent through a microwave circuit to multiply the bandwidth of the pulse by a factor of 8 and upconvert it to the 7.5-18.5 GHz range. The chirped pulse is amplified by a traveling wave tube amplifier and broadcast inside the spectrometer by using a double ridge standard gain horn antenna. The broadband molecular free induction decay (FID) is received by a second horn antenna, downconverted, and digitized by a 40 Gsampless (12 GHz hardware bandwidth) digital oscilloscope. The second design uses a simplified pulse generation and FID detection scheme, employing current state-of-the-art high-speed digital electronics. In this spectrometer, a chirped pulse with 12 GHz of bandwidth is directly generated by using a 20 Gsampless AWG and upconverted in a single step with an ultrabroadband mixer. The amplified molecular emission is directly detected by using a 50 Gsampless digital oscilloscope with 18 GHz bandwidth. In both designs, fast Fourier transform of the FID produces the frequency domain rotational spectrum in the 7-18 GHz range. The performance of the CP-FTMW spectrometer is compared to a Balle-Flygare-type cavity-FTMW spectrometer. The CP-FTMW spectrometer produces an equal sensitivity spectrum with a factor of 40 reduction in measurement time and a reduction in sample consumption by a factor of 20. The CP-FTMW spectrometer also displays good intensity accuracy for both sample number density and rotational transition moment. Strategies to reduce the CP-FTMW measurement time by another factor of 90 while simultaneously reducing the sample consumption by a factor of 30 are demonstrated.},

There are four combinations of atomic transitions within the D1 line which produce trapping: two of them are achieved with the usual orthogonal circular polarizations used in the trap operating on the D2 line, while the other two are just observed with reversed polarizations. The need of reversing the polarizations is attributed to the negative Zeeman shift of the lower hyperfine levels of the D1 transition in alkalis.

abstract = {We present an investigation of sub-Doppler effects in a cesium magneto-optical trap. First, a simple one-dimensional theoretical model of the trap is developed for aJ g = 1 →J e = 2 transition. This model predicts the size of the trapped atom cloud and temperature as a function of laser intensity and detuning. In the limit of small magnetic field gradients, the trap temperature is found to be equal to the molasses temperature and a minimum size for the trap is calculated. We then describe several experiments performed in a three-dimensional cesium trap to measure the trap parameters, spring constant, friction coefficient, temperature and density. Whilst the temperature of the trapped atoms is found to be equal to the molasses temperature, in agreement with theory, the trap spring constant is found to be two orders of magnitude smaller than the one-dimensional prediction, a value close to that predicted by Doppler models. The maximum density is found to be on the order of 1012 atoms/cm3 or one atom per optical wavelength on average. When the number of trapped atoms becomes large, the temperature begins to increase dramatically. This excess temperature depends in a very simple way on the atom number, laser intensity and detuning, suggesting that its origin lies in multiple photon scattering within the trap.},

@article{Pohl2010,
abstract = {The proton is the primary building block of the visible Universe, but many of its properties-such as its charge radius and its anomalous magnetic moment-are not well understood. The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz. On the basis of present calculations of fine and hyperfine splittings and QED terms, we find r(p) = 0.84184(67) fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value of 0.8768(69) fm. Our result implies that either the Rydberg constant has to be shifted by -110 kHz/c (4.9 standard deviations), or the calculations of the QED effects in atomic hydrogen or muonic hydrogen atoms are insufficient.},

Fused silica vapor cells containing enriched {\$}{\^{}}{\{}199{\}}{\$}Hg are arranged in a stack in a common magnetic field. Optical pumping is used to spin-polarize the atoms orthogonal to the applied magnetic field, and the Faraday rotation of near-resonant light is observed to determine an electric-field-induced perturbation to the Larmor precession frequency. Our results for this frequency shift are consistent with zero; we find the corresponding {\$}{\^{}}{\{}199{\}}{\$}Hg EDM {\$}d{\_}{\{}Hg{\}} = (-2.20 \backslashpm 2.75{\_}{\{}stat{\}} \backslashpm 1.48{\_}{\{}syst{\}}) \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-30{\}} e\backslashcdot \backslashtext{\{}cm{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {{\%}'e report the observation of near-infrared Dicke superradiant pulses. The active medium {\{}atomic Na vapor{\}} is optically pumped in the 5{\$}qg2 state and superradiates on transitions cascading down from this level at 3.41, 2.21, and 9.10 pm, The superradiant character of the emission is checked by studying variations of pulse heights and delays versus initial population inversion density. Collective spontaneous emission (Dicke super-radiance)' has been up to now difficult to observe in the optical domain. To our knowledge, the on-ly experiment so far has been performed in the far infrared (100-pm range) on rotational transi-tions of the HF molecule. ' In the visible or near infrared, and for Doppler-broadened media, su-perradiance takes place on a nanosecond time scale, much shorter than the microsecond scale of fai-infrared experiments. As a consequence, observation of the phenomenon has been impeded in the past by the lack of very fast and efficient excitation procedures able to prepare within a nanosecond a total population inversion on an op-tical transition. Using short-pulsed tunable dye lasers, we have optically pumped sodium vapor in the 5S " , state and have observed on transitions cascading down from this level what we believe to be the first direct evidence of Dicke superra-diance in the near infrared. Before describing our observations, let us first recall the main features of superradiance in a pencil-shaped sample having a length L large compared to the wavelength X of the emitted radi-ation. ' Let us consider that the atomic popula-tion is initially totally inverted on an optical tran-sition a-5 (transition probability y, ,). Because of spontaneous emission atoms start falling down from level a to b, each atom developing a ran-domly phased optical dipole. At low excited-atom density n, these dipoles remain independent of each other and the sample radiates an isotropic fluorescence signal proportional to n with a decay time y., ' (usual spontaneous emission). On the other hand, for n large enough, the dipoles of dif-ferent atoms start interacting with each other through their common coupling with the axial modes of the radiation field, the characteristic coupling time being ' 4 v'n = 8s (y, {\~{}}nLA.) '. After a delay {\~{}}{\~{}} proportional to 7{\&}, all the dipoles strong-ly lock in phase with each other and radiate, along the axis of the active medium, a light pulse 5S 4S 4P {\~{}}5 30 3P3], 3 P)(2 photo diode t ', = {\~{}}" (A2) (PM. —:-: —", II B)({\~{}})) @ 3S F)] I " Sb i detector FIG. 1. {\{}a) Diagram of Na energy levels relevant for superradiance experiment.

@article{Andresen2010,
abstract = {Antimatter was first predicted in 1931, by Dirac. Work with high-energy antiparticles is now commonplace, and anti-electrons are used regularly in the medical technique of positron emission tomography scanning. Antihydrogen, the bound state of an antiproton and a positron, has been produced at low energies at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) since 2002. Antihydrogen is of interest for use in a precision test of nature's fundamental symmetries. The charge conjugation/parity/time reversal (CPT) theorem, a crucial part of the foundation of the standard model of elementary particles and interactions, demands that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Given the current experimental precision of measurements on the hydrogen atom (about two parts in 10(14) for the frequency of the 1s-to-2s transition), subjecting antihydrogen to rigorous spectroscopic examination would constitute a compelling, model-independent test of CPT. Antihydrogen could also be used to study the gravitational behaviour of antimatter. However, so far experiments have produced antihydrogen that is not confined, precluding detailed study of its structure. Here we demonstrate trapping of antihydrogen atoms. From the interaction of about 10(7) antiprotons and 7 × 10(8) positrons, we observed 38 annihilation events consistent with the controlled release of trapped antihydrogen from our magnetic trap; the measured background is 1.4 ± 1.4 events. This result opens the door to precision measurements on anti-atoms, which can soon be subjected to the same techniques as developed for hydrogen.},

abstract = {The ability to cool atoms below the Doppler limit -- the minimum temperature reachable by Doppler cooling -- has been essential to most experiments with quantum degenerate gases, optical lattices and atomic fountains, among many other applications. A broad set of new applications await ultracold molecules, and the extension of laser cooling to molecules has begun. A molecular magneto-optical trap has been demonstrated, where molecules approached the Doppler limit. However, the sub-Doppler temperatures required for most applications have not yet been reached. Here we cool molecules to 50 uK, well below the Doppler limit, using a three-dimensional optical molasses. These ultracold molecules could be loaded into optical tweezers to trap arbitrary arrays for quantum simulation, launched into a molecular fountain for testing fundamental physics, and used to study ultracold collisions and ultracold chemistry.},

@article{Bakr2009,
abstract = {Recent years have seen tremendous progress in creating complex atomic many-body quantum systems. One approach is to use macroscopic, effectively thermodynamic ensembles of ultracold atoms to create quantum gases and strongly correlated states of matter, and to analyse the bulk properties of the ensemble. For example, bosonic and fermionic atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice can be used for quantum simulations of solid-state models. The opposite approach is to build up microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom, with complete control over all degrees of freedom. The atoms or ions act as qubits and allow the realization of quantum gates, with the goal of creating highly controllable quantum information systems. Until now, the macroscopic and microscopic strategies have been fairly disconnected. Here we present a quantum gas 'microscope' that bridges the two approaches, realizing a system in which atoms of a macroscopic ensemble are detected individually and a complete set of degrees of freedom for each of them is determined through preparation and measurement. By implementing a high-resolution optical imaging system, single atoms are detected with near-unity fidelity on individual sites of a Hubbard-regime optical lattice. The lattice itself is generated by projecting a holographic mask through the imaging system. It has an arbitrary geometry, chosen to support both strong tunnel coupling between lattice sites and strong on-site confinement. Our approach can be used to directly detect strongly correlated states of matter; in the context of condensed matter simulation, this corresponds to the detection of individual electrons in the simulated crystal. Also, the quantum gas microscope may enable addressing and read-out of large-scale quantum information systems based on ultracold atoms.},

@article{Veldhoven2004,
abstract = {Ultimately, the resolution of any spectroscopic experiment is limited by the interaction time between the particles that are to be examined and the measuring device. The obtainable spectroscopic resolution in a molecular beam experiment can be considerably improved using samples of slow molecules, as produced, for example, in a Stark-decelerator. This is demonstrated here by measuring the inversion tunneling spectrum of (ND3)-N-15 using a pulsed molecular beam that has been decelerated to about 52 m/s. Hyperfine resolved inversion transitions in (ND3)-N-15 in the J, K{\textgreater}=1, 1{\textgreater} state (around 1.43 GHz) are induced in a microwave region, and (ND3)-N-15 molecules that have undergone the transition are subsequently detected using a UV-laser based ionization detection scheme. To increase the signal intensity; the decelerated molecular beam is both transversally and longitudinally focused into the laser detection region. The observed spectral width of individual hyperfine transitions in the fully resolved spectrum is about 1 kHz; and the standard deviation of the best fit is 62 Hz.},

With magnetic fields reduced to 200 pT or less, the electric field lifts the degeneracy between hyperfine levels of different|mF| and, along with the slow beam and fountain geometry, suppresses systematics from motional magnetic fields. Transitions are induced and the atoms polarized and analyzed in field-free regions. The feasibility of reaching a sensitivity to an electron EDM of 2 x 10 exp(-50) C-m [1.3 x 10 exp(-29) e-cm] in a cesium fountain experiment is discussed.},

Microwave optical double resonance (MODR) measurements were also made on several low-J transitions to obtain precise spectroscopic constants of the X2?? state. The present set of molecular constants for both the A2?? and X2?? states represent a vast improvement in precision over previously reported values because of the larger number of line position measurements and the use of a more reasonable Hamiltonian. The excellent agreement between the rotational constants derived from the optical and microwave measurements fully validates the assignments. Important derived constants are listed below (in cm-1) with 95{\%} confidence limits in parentheses. ?? 1978.},

Both pure rotational and fine-structure transitions have been observed; lambda-type doubling is resolved on all the observed transitions. The energy levels of FeH are strongly affected by the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and cannot be modeled accurately by an effective Hamiltonian. The data are therefore fitted to an empirical formula to yield term values and g factors for the various spin-rotational levels involved. Many of the resonances show a doubling that arises from the proton hyperfine structure. These splittings are analyzed in a similar manner.},

Beam dynamics, thermalization and slowing are studied using laser spectroscopy. The key to this hybrid, effusive-like beam source is a "slowing cell" placed immediately after a hydrodynamic, cryogenic source [Patterson et al., J. Chem. Phys., 2007, 126, 154307]. The resulting CaH beams are created in two regimes. In one regime, a modestly boosted beam has a forward velocity of v(f) = 65 m s(-1), a narrow velocity spread, and a flux of 10(9) molecules per pulse. In the other regime, our slowest beam has a forward velocity of v(f) = 40 m s(-1), a longitudinal temperature of 3.6 K, and a flux of 5 × 10(8) molecules per pulse.},

abstract = {The ground state X1$\Sigma$+ of NaCs was studied by laser induced fluorescence Fourier-transform spectroscopy. An accurate potential energy curve was derived from more than 5000 transitions. This potential reproduces the experimental observations within their uncertainties of ±0.003 cm-1 and covers about 99.97{\%} of the potential well depth. Few vibrational levels of the shallow state a3$\Sigma$ +below the atomic ground state asymptote were observed. The identification is mainly done by the observed and quantitatively interpreted molecular hyperfine structure applying atomic parameters of the ground states of Na and Cs. An estimated potential curve for a3$\Sigma$+ is reported which can be used together with that of X1$\Sigma$ + for coupled channel calculations of cold collisions between Na and Cs. An example is given. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences, Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The charge distribution associated with an electron has surprising implications for a number of outstanding mysteries in physics. Why is the universe made out of matter versus anti-matter, instead of both equally? What new particles and interactions lie beyond the current reach of accelerators like the LHC? Models which propose answers to these questions, such as Supersymmetry, tend to predict a small, yet potentially measurable, asymmetric interaction between an electron and an electric field, characterized by an electric dipole moment (EDM). Despite over six decades of experimental searching, no EDM of any fundamental particle has ever been measured; however, these experiments continue to provide some of the most stringent limits on new physics. Here, we present the results of a new search for the electron EDM, de = (−2.1 ± 3.7stat ± 2.5syst) × 10−29 e cm, which represents an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity from the previous best limit. Since our measurement is consistent with zero, we present the upper limit of |de| {\textless} 8.7 × 10−29 e cm with 90 percent confidence.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays are important devices for high throughput measurements of gene expression, but no rational foundation has been established for understanding the sources of within-chip statistical error. We designed a specialized chip and protocol to investigate the distribution and magnitude of within-chip errors and discovered that, as expected from theoretical expectations, measurement errors follow a Lorentzian-like distribution, which explains the widely observed but unexplained ill-reproducibility in microarray data. Using this specially designed chip, we examined a data set of repeated measurements to extract estimates of the distribution and magnitude of statistical errors in DNA microarray measurements. Using the common "ratio of medians" method, we find that the measurements follow a Lorentzian-like distribution, which is problematic for subsequent analysis. We show that a method of analysis dubbed "median of ratios" yields a more Gaussian-like distribution of errors. Finally, we show that the bootstrap algorithm can be used to extract the best estimates of the error in the measurement. Quantifying the statistical error in such measurements has important applications for estimating significance levels, clustering algorithms, and process optimization.},

We describe ensemble measurements on small, rotating clusters of interacting bosonic atoms, demonstrating that they can be induced into quantum ground states closely analogous to topological states of electronic systems. We report measurements of inter-particle correlations and momentum distributions of Bose gases in the fractional quantum Hall limit, making comparison to a full numerical simulation. The novel experimental apparatus necessary to produce and measure properties of these deeply entangled quantum states is described.},

abstract = {Geometric phases arise in a number of physical situations and often lead to systematic shifts in frequencies or phases measured in precision experiments. We describe, by working through some simple examples, a method to calculate geometric phases that relies only on standard quantum mechanical calculations of energy level shifts. This connection between geometric phases and off-resonant energy shifts simplifies calculation of the effect in certain situations. More generally, it also provides a way to understand and calculate geometric phases without recourse to topology.},

abstract = {The ability to cool and slow atoms with light for subsequent trapping allows investigations of the properties and interactions of the trapped atoms in unprecedented detail. By contrast, the complex structure of molecules prohibits this type of manipulation, but magnetic trapping of calcium hydride molecules thermalized in ultra-cold buffer gas and optical trapping of caesium dimers generated from ultra-cold caesium atoms have been reported. However, these methods depend on the target molecules being paramagnetic or able to form through the association of atoms amenable to laser cooling, respectively, thus restricting the range of species that can be studied. Here we describe the slowing of an adiabatically cooled beam of deuterated ammonia molecules by time-varying inhomogeneous electric fields and subsequent loading into an electrostatic trap. We are able to trap state-selected ammonia molecules with a density of 10(6) cm(-3) in a volume of 0.25 cm3 at temperatures below 0.35 K. We observe pronounced density oscillations caused by the rapid switching of the electric fields during loading of the trap. Our findings illustrate that polar molecules can be efficiently cooled and trapped, thus providing an opportunity to study collisions and collective quantum effects in a wide range of ultra-cold molecular systems.},

abstract = {at simple fractional values of n. (See PHYSICS TODAY, December 1998, page 17.) But subsequent work has shown that it describes a superstructure that encompass-es other phenomena as well. The quickest way to introduce the composite fermion is through the following series of steps, which I call the " Bohr theory " of composite fermions because it obtains some of the essential results with the help of an over-simpified but useful picture. The outcome is that strongly interacting electrons in a strong magnetic field B trans-form into weakly interacting composite fermions in a weaker effective magnetic field B * , given by B* = B – 2prv 0 , (2) where 2p is an even integer. Equivalently, one can say that electrons at filling factor n convert into composite fermions with filling factor n * = rv 0 /+B * +, given by (3) The minus sign corresponds to situations when B * points antiparallel to B. Start by considering interacting electrons in the transverse magnetic field B. Now attach to each electron an infinitely thin, massless magnetic solenoid carrying 2p flux quanta pointing antiparallel to B, turning it into a composite fermion. Such a conversion preserves the minus sign associated with an exchange of two fermions, because the bound state of an electron and an even num-ber of flux quanta is itself a fermion. Hence the name. It also leaves the Aharonov–Bohm phase factors associated with all closed paths unchanged, because the additional phase factor due to a flux v = 2pv 0 is exp{\{}2piv/v 0 {\}} = 1. In other words, the attached flux is unobservable, and the new problem, formulated in terms of composite fermions, is identical to the one with which we began. So, what have we gained? Well, a " mean-field approx-imation " now suggests itself, in which the new attached magnetic field is smeared to produce an additional uni-form magnetic field ⊗ 2prv 0 . With that addition, we get the net magnetic field B * of equation 2. The net effect, in a sense, is that each electron has absorbed 2p flux quanta from the external field to become a composite fermion that experiences only the residual magnetic field B},

Recent developments in both atomic theory and experimental methods have led to the ability to make extremely precise theoretical calculations and experimental measure-ments of these effects. Such studies are complementary to direct high-energy searches, and can be performed for only a fraction of the cost. We review the recent progress in the field of parity and time-reversal violation in atoms, molecules, and nuclei, and examine the implications for physics beyond the Standard Model, with an emphasis on possible areas for development in the near future.},

Control of this offset with nanometer precision allows for adjustment of the coupling strength between different motional states, analogous to an adjustable effective Lamb-Dicke factor. This is used both for efficient one-dimensional sideband cooling of individual atoms to a vibrational ground state population of 97{\%} and to drive coherent Rabi oscillation between arbitrary pairs of vibrational states. We further show that microwaves can drive well resolved transitions between motional states in maximally offset, shallow lattices, and thus in principle allow for coherent control of long-range quantum transport.},

abstract = {Dark sectors, consisting of new, light, weakly-coupled particles that do not interact with the known strong, weak, or electromagnetic forces, are a particularly compelling possibility for new physics. Nature may contain numerous dark sectors, each with their own beautiful structure, distinct particles, and forces. This review summarizes the physics motivation for dark sectors and the exciting opportunities for experimental exploration. It is the summary of the Intensity Frontier subgroup "New, Light, Weakly-coupled Particles" of the Community Summer Study 2013 (Snowmass). We discuss axions, which solve the strong CP problem and are an excellent dark matter candidate, and their generalization to axion-like particles. We also review dark photons and other dark-sector particles, including sub-GeV dark matter, which are theoretically natural, provide for dark matter candidates or new dark matter interactions, and could resolve outstanding puzzles in particle and astro-particle physics. In many cases, the exploration of dark sectors can proceed with existing facilities and comparatively modest experiments. A rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program has been identified that has the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. These physics opportunities should be vigorously pursued in the US and elsewhere.},

abstract = {Cold molecules promise to reveal a rich set of novel collision dynamics in the low-energy regime. By combining for the first time the techniques of Stark deceleration, magnetic trapping, and cryogenic buffer gas cooling, we present the first experimental observation of cold collisions between two different species of state-selected neutral polar molecules. This has enabled an absolute measurement of the total trap loss cross sections between OH and ND(3) at a mean collision energy of 3.6 cm(-1) (5 K). Due to the dipolar interaction, the total cross section increases upon application of an external polarizing electric field. Cross sections computed from ab initio potential energy surfaces are in agreement with the measured value at zero external electric field. The theory presented here represents the first such analysis of collisions between a (2)$\Pi$ radical and a closed-shell polyatomic molecule.},

We also discuss the "weak loading" and "strong loading" regimes outside the blockade range, and we demonstrate experimentally the existence of these three regimes.},

The molecular calculations are performed using an ab initio approach based on nonempirical pseudopotential, parametrized l-dependent polarization potentials and full configuration interaction calculations through the CIPCI quantum chemistry package. The derived spectroscopic constants (Re, De, Te, $\omega$e, $\omega$exe, and Be) of the ground state and lower excited states are compared with the available theoretical and experimental works. Moreover, accurate permanent and transition dipole moment have been determined as a function of the internuclear distance. The adiabatic permanent dipole moment for the first nine (1)$\Sigma$(+) electronic states have shown both ionic characters associated with electron transfer related to Cs(+)Na(-) and Cs(-)Na(+) arrangements. By a simple rotation, the diabatic permanent dipole moment is determined and has revealed a linear behavior, particularly at intermediate and large distances. Many peaks around the avoided crossing locations have been observed for the transition dipole moment between neighbor electronic states.},

abstract = {Many modern theories predict that the fundamental constants depend on time, position or the local density of matter. Here we develop a spectroscopic method for pulsed beams of cold molecules, and use it to measure the frequencies of microwave transitions in CH with accuracy down to 3 Hz. By comparing these frequencies with those measured from sources of CH in the Milky Way, we test the hypothesis that fundamental constants may differ between the high- and low-density environments of the Earth and the interstellar medium. For the fine structure constant we find $\Delta$$\alpha$/$\alpha$=(0.3 ± 1.1) × 10⁻⁷, the strongest limit to date on such a variation of $\alpha$. For the electron-to-proton mass ratio we find $\Delta$$\mu$/$\mu$=(-0.7 ± 2.2) × 10⁻⁷. We suggest how dedicated astrophysical measurements can improve these constraints further and can also constrain temporal variation of the constants.},

abstract = {Over the past several decades, quantum information science has emerged to seek answers to the question: can we gain some advantage by storing, transmitting and processing information encoded in systems that exhibit unique quantum properties? Today it is understood that the answer is yes, and many research groups around the world are working towards the highly ambitious technological goal of building a quantum computer, which would dramatically improve computational power for particular tasks. A number of physical systems, spanning much of modern physics, are being developed for quantum computation. However, it remains unclear which technology, if any, will ultimately prove successful. Here we describe the latest developments for each of the leading approaches and explain the major challenges for the future.},

abstract = {A method for reducing the inhomogeneous broadening in the spectroscopic measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of optically trapped atoms is demonstrated. This reduction is achieved by the addition of a very weak light field (the "compensating beam"), whose frequency is tuned between the two hyperfine levels. The total shift is obtained by adding the shifts from the trap and the compensating beam, and a complete cancellation of the inhomogeneous broadening will occur for an intensity ratio of {\&}sim; ({\&}Delta;HF/2{\&}delta;)2. With the suppression of inhomogeneous broadening, the atomic coherence time is next limited by the much smaller spontaneous scattering time. Finally, the introduction of the compensating beam provides with an experimental method to control the decoherence rate of the atomic ensemble, and thus to study the interesting interplay between dynamics and coherence in systems with a rich phase-space, for example in atom-optics billiards.},

Starting from a magneto-optical trap at 70 $\mu$K, the cooling time was on the order of 1 ms with almost 100{\%} capture efficiency and temperature smaller than 5 $\mu$K measured.

@article{Brown1975,
abstract = {The rotational energy levels of diatomic and linear polyatomic molecules often occur in closely spaced pairs of opposite parity. In this situation the lower levels of each pair usually form a characteristic set (for example, it may be possible to describe them all with a single energy level expression) even though their parities alternate with the rota-tional quantum number; similarly, the upper levels of each pair form a second distinct set. Mulliken (1) introduced a labeling scheme in order to distinguish between these sets for diatomic molecules; his labels are c and d for case (a) and case (b) states, and e and f for case (c) states. However, his rules for assigning these labels require care in their appli-cation and are hard to memorize. Herzberg (2) introduced an alternative definition of G and d for singlet states of diatomic molecules which differs from that of Mulliken for odd values of A. Some authors have extended this system to multiplet states, though the rules for such an extension have never been clearly defined. Other authors have used the labels c and d to denote the upper and lower series of parity doublets respectively, or the converse. The confusion which has arisen in the literature is unfortunately widespread and a reexamination of the problem is clearly needed. It is understandable that molecu-lar spectroscopists have been reluctant to advocate yet another labeling scheme, but for-tunately there now appears to be a strong consensus in favor of one particular scheme and it is the purpose of this letter to draw attention to it. In a discussion of the rotational levels in D = 3 states, Kopp and Hougen (3) intro-duced a simple labeling scheme for molecules with an odd number of electrons (},

Due to the large difference of polarizability to mass ratio between the buffer gas and the CO molecules in the pulsed jet, the buffer gas can be precluded from the fraction of stationary molecules by choosing a suitable pulse duration. Furthermore, we find that spatial bunching within the optical lattice is induced and the position of the bunch within the lattice can be chosen by varying the lattice velocity.},

  title = {Schemes for robust quantum computation with polar molecules},
  abstract = {We propose to use a new platform - ultracold polar molecules - for quantum computing with switchable interactions. The on/off switch is accomplished by selective excitation of one of the "0" or "1" qubits - long-lived molecular states - to an "excited" molecular state with a considerably different dipole moment. We describe various schemes based on this switching of dipolar interactions where the selective excitation between ground and excited states is accomplished via optical, micro-wave, or electric fields. We also generalize the schemes to take advantage of the dipole blockade mechanism when dipolar interactions are very strong. These schemes can be realized in several recently proposed architectures.},

abstract = {The general idea that optical radiation may cool matter was put forward 80 years ago. Doppler cooling of dilute atomic gases is an extremely successful application of this concept. More recently, anti-Stokes cooling in multilevel systems has been explored, culminating in the optical refrigeration of solids. Collisional redistribution of radiation has been proposed as a different cooling mechanism for atomic two-level systems, although experimental investigations using moderate-density gases have not reached the cooling regime. Here we experimentally demonstrate laser cooling of an atomic gas based on collisional redistribution of radiation, using rubidium atoms in argon buffer gas at a pressure of 230 bar. The frequent collisions in the ultradense gas transiently shift a highly red-detuned laser beam (that is, one detuned to a much lower frequency) into resonance, whereas spontaneous decay occurs close to the unperturbed atomic resonance frequency. During each excitation cycle, kinetic energy of order k(B)T-that is, the thermal energy (k(B), Boltzmann's constant; T, temperature)-is extracted from the dense atomic sample. In a proof-of-principle experiment with a thermally non-isolated sample, we demonstrate relative cooling by 66 K. The cooled gas has a density more than ten orders of magnitude greater than the typical values used in Doppler-cooling experiments, and the cooling power reaches 87 mW. Future applications of the technique may include supercooling beyond the homogeneous nucleation temperature and optical chillers.},

Within the experimental (3) 1pi state v' ranged from v' = 0 to 34, q values exhibited a pronounced decrease from 7.91x10(-6) to 0.47x10(-6) cm(-1), while absolute value(d) values varied between 8.0 and 5.0 D. Experimental evaluation yielded small d values about 1 D for D2 1pi state v' {\textless} 3 levels. The experiment is supported by ab initio electronic structure calculations performed for the (1-3) 1pi states of NaCs by means of the many-body multipartitioning perturbation theory of potential energy curves, permanent dipole, and angular coupling matrix elements for the lowest singlet states. The predicted d values reproduce their experimental counterparts within the measurement errors while theoretical q factors reproduce the measured v' dependence being, however, systematically overestimated by ca. 1x10(-6) cm(-1). The present NaCs data are compared with those of the NaK and NaRb molecules.},

abstract = {On excitation at 193 nm, tetrahydrofuran (THF) generates OH as one of the photodissociation products. The nascent energy state distribution of the OH radical was measured employing laser induced fluorescence technique. It is observed that the OH radical is formed mostly in the ground vibrational level, with low rotational excitation (approximately 3{\%}). The rotational distribution of OH (v"=0,J) is characterized by rotational temperature of 1250+/-140 K. Two spin-orbit states, 2Pi3/2 and 2Pi1/2 of OH are populated statistically. But, there is a preferential population in Lambda doublet levels. For all rotational numbers, the 2Pi+(A') levels are preferred to the 2Pi-(A") levels. The relative translational energy associated with the photoproducts in the OH channel is calculated to be 17.4+/-2.2 kcal mol-1, giving an fT value of approximately 36{\%}, and the remaining 61{\%} of the available energy is distributed in the internal modes of the other photofragment, i.e., C4H7. The observed distribution of the available energy agrees well with a hybrid model of energy partitioning, predicting an exit barrier of approximately 16 kcal mol-1. Based on both ab initio molecular orbital calculations and experimental results, a plausible mechanism for OH formation is proposed. The mechanism involves three steps, the C-O bond cleavage of the ring, H atom migration to the O atom, and the C-OH bond scission, in sequence, to generate OH from the ground electronic state of THF. Besides this high energy reaction channel, other photodissociation channels of THF have been identified by detecting the stable products, using Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography.},

abstract = {Electrons moving in two dimensions under the influence of strong magnetic fields effectively lose their kinetic energy and display exotic behaviour dominated by Coulomb forces. When the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta in the system ($\nu$) is near 5/2, the electrons are predicted to condense into a correlated phase with fractionally charged quasiparticles and a ground-state degeneracy that grows exponentially as these quasiparticles are introduced. The only way for electrons to transform between the many ground states would be to braid the fractional excitations around each other. This property has been proposed as the basis of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Here we present observations of localized quasiparticles at $\nu$ = 5/2, confined to puddles by disorder. Using a local electrometer to compare how quasiparticles at $\nu$ = 5/2 and $\nu$ = 7/3 charge these puddles, we were able to extract the ratio of local charges for these states. Averaged over several disorder configurations and samples, we found the ratio to be 4/3, suggesting that the local charges are = e/3 and = e/4, where e is the charge of an electron. This is in agreement with theoretical predictions for a paired state at $\nu$ = 5/2. Confirming the existence of localized e/4 quasiparticles shows that proposed interferometry experiments to test statistics and computational ability of the state at $\nu$ = 5/2 would be possible.},

Our technique enables space- and time-resolved characterization of the number statistics across the superfluid-Mott insulator quantum phase transition. Site-resolved probing of fluctuations provides us with a sensitive local thermometer, allows us to identify microscopic heterostructures of low-entropy Mott domains, and enables us to measure local quantum dynamics, revealing surprisingly fast transition time scales. Our results may serve as a benchmark for theoretical studies of quantum dynamics, and may guide the engineering of low-entropy phases in a lattice.},

abstract = {Owing to the particular environment of the JEM4000EX HREM at the University of Pennsylvania, it became necessary to control the magnetic environment around the microscope. The unstable magnetic environment included two components, a slowly wandering vertical DC magnetic field and an AC magnetic field. The effects of these fields on the microscope performance were to introduce an uncertainty in the objective lens defocus value over a series of images and to reduce the attainable resolution of the microscope, respectively. A solution is presented in which these fields are stably reduced well within the limits of sensitivity of the JEOL, Ltd. JEM4000EX for high-resolution imaging. This solution is based on a feedback loop using a pseudo-Helmholtz coil to generate a well-defined vertical magnetic field.},

abstract = {We perform laser induced fluorescence(LIF) spectroscopy on a pulsed supersonic beam of tungsten carbide(WC) molecules, which has been proposed as a candidate molecular system for a permanent Electric Dipole Moment(EDM) search of the electron in its rovibrational ground state of the X3Delta1 state. In particular, [20.6]Omega=2, v'=4 {\textless}- X3Delta1,v"=0 transition at 485nm was used for the detection. The hyperfine structure and the Omega-doublet of the transition are measured, which are essential for estimating the size of the potential systematic uncertainties for electron EDM measurement. For further suppression of the systematic uncertainty, an alternative electron EDM measurement scheme utilizing the g factor crossing point of the Omega-doublet levels is discussed. On the other hand, flux and internal temperature of the molecular beam are characterized, which sets the limit on the statistical uncertainty of the electron EDM experiment. With the given results, the prospect of electron EDM experiment with the X3Delta1 state of WC molecule is discussed.},

This study relates to the long-standing debate about the nature of the superfluid state in Fermi systems.

For strong interactions, near a Feshbach resonance, superfluidity was observed for a broad range of population imbalances. We mapped out the superfluid regime as a function of interaction strength and population imbalance and characterized the quantum phase transition to the normal state, known as the Pauli limit of superfluidity.},

abstract = {Microscopically controlled neutral atoms in optical tweezers and lattices have led to exciting advances in the study of quantum information and quantum many-body systems. The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.},

@article{Stoeffler2011,
abstract = {Originating from the weak interaction, parity violation in chiral molecules has been considered as a possible origin of biohomochirality. We have proposed the observation of molecular parity violation using the two-photon Ramsey fringes technique on a supersonic beam. As a first step in this direction, a detailed spectroscopic study of methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) has been undertaken. It is an ideal test molecule as the achiral parent molecule of chiral candidates for a parity violation experiment. For the (187)Re MTO isotopologue, a combined analysis of Fourier transform microwave and infrared spectra as well as ultra-high resolution CO(2) laser absorption spectra enabled the assignment of 28 rotational lines and 71 rovibrational lines, some of them with a resolved hyperfine structure. A set of spectroscopic parameters in the ground and first excited state, including hyperfine structure constants, was obtained for the $\nu$(as) antisymmetric Re=O stretching mode of this molecule. This result validates the experimental approach to be followed once a chiral derivative of MTO is synthesized, and shows the benefit of the combination of several spectroscopic techniques in different spectral regions, with different set-ups and resolutions. The first high resolution spectra of jet-cooled MTO, obtained on a set-up being developed for the observation of molecular parity violation, are shown, which constitutes a major step towards the targeted objective.},

abstract = {A new molecular beam resonance method using separated oscillating fields at the incident and emergent ends of the homogeneous field region is theoretically investigated in this paper. An expression is obtained for the quantum mechanical transition probability of a system between two states when the system is sub- jected to such separated oscillating fields. This is numerically averaged over the molecular velocity distribution and provides the theoretical shape of the resonance curves. It is found that resonances with such a technique have a theoretical half-width only 0.6 as great as those by conventional molecular beam resonance methods. In addition to producing sharper resonance minima, the new method has its resonances much less broadened by inhomogeneities of the mixed field, it makes possible resonance experiments in regions into which an oscillating field cannot be introduced, and it is more convenient and effective with short wavelength radiation.},

abstract = {Resonant energy transfers, i.e. the non-radiative redistribution of an electronic excitation between two particles coupled by the dipole-dipole interaction, lie at the heart of a variety of chemical and biological phenomena, most notably photosynthesis. In 1948, F{\"{o}}rster established the theoretical basis of fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET), paving the ground towards the widespread use of FRET as a "spectroscopic ruler" for the determination of nanometer-scale distances in biomolecules. The underlying mechanism is a coherent dipole-dipole coupling between particles, as already recognized in the early days of quantum mechanics, but this coherence was not directly observed so far. Here, we study, both spectroscopically and in the time domain, the coherent, dipolar-induced exchange of electronic excitations between two single Rydberg atoms separated by a controlled distance as large as 15 microns, and brought into resonance by applying a small electric field. The coherent oscillation of the system between two degenerate pair states occurs at a frequency that scales as the inverse third power of the distance, the hallmark of dipole-dipole interactions. Our results not only demonstrate, at the most fundamental level of two atoms, the basic mechanism underlying FRET, but also open exciting prospects for active tuning of strong, coherent interactions in quantum many-body systems.},

abstract = {We present a detailed experimental study of the physics involved in transferring atoms from a magnetooptical trap (MOT) to an optical dipole trap. The loading is a dynamical process determined by a loading rate and a density dependent loss rate. The loading rate depends on cooling and the flux of atoms into the trapping volume, and the loss rate is due to excited state collisions induced by the MOT light fields. From this study we found ways to optimize the loading of the optical dipole trap. Key ingredients for maximum loading are found to be a reduction of the hyperfine repump intensity, increased detuning of the MOT light, and a displacement of the optical dipole trap center with respect to the MOT. A factor of 2 increase in the number of loaded atoms is demonstrated by using a hyperfine repump beam with a shadow in it. In this way we load 8 X 10(6) Rb-85 atoms into a 1 mK deep optical dipole trap with a waist of 58 mu m, which is 40{\%} of the atoms initially trapped in the MOT.},

One of the microscope objectives allows local imaging of the trapped Fermi gas of 6Li atoms with a maximum resolution of 660 nm, while the other enables the generation of arbitrary optical dipole potentials on the same length scale. Employing a 2D acousto-optical deflector, we demonstrate the formation of several trapping geometries including a tightly focussed single optical dipole trap, a 4x4-site two-dimensional optical lattice and a 8-site ring lattice configuration. Furthermore, we show the ability to load and detect a small number of atoms in these trapping potentials.

@phdthesis{Barry2013,
abstract = {Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. It has been roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms, leading to rapid advances in a vast array of fields and a number of Nobel prizes. Prior to the work presented in this thesis, laser cooling had not yet been extended to molecules because of their complex internal structure. However, this complexity makes molecules potentially useful for a wide range of applications. The first direct laser cooling of a molecule and further results we present here provide a new route to ultracold temperatures for molecules. In particular, these methods bridge the gap between ultracold temperatures and the approximately 1 kelvin temperatures attainable with directly cooled molecules (e.g. with cryogenic buffer gas cooling or decelerated supersonic beams). Using the carefully chosen molecule strontium monofluoride (SrF), decays to unwanted vibrational states are suppressed. Driving a transition with rotational quantum number R=1 to an excited state with R'=0 eliminates decays to unwanted rotational states. The dark ground-state Zeeman sublevels present in this specific scheme are remixed via a static magnetic field. Using three lasers for this scheme, a given molecule should undergo an average of approximately 100,000 photon absorption/emission cycles before being lost via unwanted decays. This number of cycles should be sufficient to load a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of molecules. In this thesis, we demonstrate transverse cooling of an SrF beam, in both Doppler and a Sisyphus-type cooling regimes. We also realize longitudinal slowing of an SrF beam. Finally, we detail current progress towards trapping SrF in a MOT. Ultimately, this technique should enable the production of large samples of molecules at ultracold temperatures for molecules chemically distinct from competing methods.},

This spectrometer utilizes the intrapulse method, an example of sweep integration, in which the almost linear wavelength up-chirp obtained from a distributed feedback, quantum cascade laser yields a spectral microwindow of as many as 2.5 wave numbers/cm(-1). Within this spectral microwindow, molecular fingerprints can be monitored and recorded in real time.

@article{Labuhn2016,
abstract = {Spin models are the prime example of simplified manybody Hamiltonians used to model complex, real-world strongly correlated materials. However, despite their simplified character, their dynamics often cannot be simulated exactly on classical computers as soon as the number of particles exceeds a few tens. For this reason, the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of atomic and molecular physics has become very active over the last years, using ultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions. All of these approaches have their own assets, but also limitations. Here, we report on a novel platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in two-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary geometries, where filling fractions range from 60 to 100{\%} with exact knowledge of the initial configuration. When excited to Rydberg D-states, the atoms undergo strong interactions whose anisotropic character opens exciting prospects for simulating exotic matter. We illustrate the versatility of our system by studying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field with up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions, and for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the anisotropy is expected to have small effects we find an excellent agreement with ab-initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly anisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D-states has a measurable influence. Our findings establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as a versatile platform for the study of quantum magnetism.},

abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La(2)CuO(4), have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators. This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field.},

@article{Curtiss1941,
abstract = {The use of transformations to stabilize the variance of binomial or Poisson data is familiar(Anscombe 1, Bartlett 2, 3, Curtiss 4, Eisenhart 5). The comparison of transformed binomial or Poisson data with percentage points of the normal distribution to make approximate significance tests or to set approximate confidence intervals is less familiar. Mosteller and Tukey 6 have recently made a graphical application of a transformation related to the square-root transformation for such purposes, where the use of "binomial probability paper" avoids all computation. We report here on an empirical study of a number of approximations, some intended for significance and confidence work and others for variance stabilization. For significance testing and the setting of confidence limits, we should like to use the normal deviate K exceeded with the same probability as the number of successes x from n in a binomial distribution with expectation np, which is defined by frac12pi int{\^{}}K-infty e{\^{}}-frac12t{\^{}}2 dt = operatornameProb x leq k mid operatornamebinomial, n, p. The most useful approximations to K that we can propose here are N (very simple), N{\^{}}+ (accurate near the usual percentage points), and N{\^{}}astast (quite accurate generally), where N = 2 (sqrt(k + 1)q - sqrt(n - k)p). (This is the approximation used with binomial probability paper.) N{\^{}}+ = N + fracN + 2p - 112sqrtE,quad E = textlesser of np textand nq, N{\^{}}ast = N + frac(N - 2)(N + 2)12 big(frac1sqrtnp + 1 - frac1sqrtnq + 1big), N{\^{}}astast = N{\^{}}ast + fracN{\^{}}ast + 2p - 112 sqrtEcdotquad E = textlesser of np textand nq. For variance stabilization, the averaged angular transformation sin{\^{}}-1sqrtfracxn + 1 + sin{\^{}}-1 sqrtfracx + 1n+1 has variance within pm 6{\%} of frac1n + frac12 text(angles in radians), frac821n + frac12 text(angles in degrees), for almost all cases where np geq 1. In the Poisson case, this simplifies to using sqrtx + sqrtx + 1 as having variance 1.},

abstract = {The Pfaffian state is an attractive candidate for the observed quantized Hall plateau at a Landau-level filling fraction nu=5/2. This is particularly intriguing because this state has unusual topological properties, including quasiparticle excitations with non-Abelian braiding statistics. In order to determine the nature of the nu=5/2 state, one must measure the quasiparticle braiding statistics. Here, we propose an experiment which can simultaneously determine the braiding statistics of quasiparticle excitations and, if they prove to be non-Abelian, produce a topologically protected qubit on which a logical Not operation is performed by quasiparticle braiding. Using the measured excitation gap at nu=5/2, we estimate the error rate to be 10(-30) or lower.},

The HCN molecules were cooled to these temperatures using the collisional cooling technique. As a test of this cooling technique we measured the Doppler contribution to the spectral lines, and these measurements confirm that the molecules are at the same temperature as the walls of the spectroscopic cell. We observed that the hyperfine components of the 2 {\textless}-- 1 transition have distinct broadening coefficients that differ from one another by as much as 5{\%}. The measured differences are in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. We have also performed molecular scattering calculations on three He-HCN potential energy surfaces in order to compare our results with theoretical expectations. At the lowest temperatures these calculations predict broadening coefficients that are considerably larger than the measured coefficients. We have previously found a similar discrepancy for two other molecules at these low temperatures, and we discuss possible experimental and theoretical origins for this persistent discrepancy.},

abstract = {Polar molecules have a rich internal structure and long-range dipole-dipole interactions, making them useful for quantum-controlled applications and fundamental investigations. Their potential fully unfolds at ultracold temperatures, where various effects are predicted in many-body physics, quantum information science, ultracold chemistry and physics beyond the standard model. Whereas a wide range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles have been developed, the cooling of polyatomic molecules (that is, with three or more atoms) to ultracold temperatures has seemed intractable. Here we report the experimental realization of optoelectrical cooling, a recently proposed cooling and accumulation method for polar molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's kinetic energy in each cycle of the cooling sequence via a Sisyphus effect, allowing cooling with only a few repetitions of the dissipative decay process. We demonstrate the potential of optoelectrical cooling by reducing the temperature of about one million CH(3)F molecules by a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 (or a factor of 70 discounting trap losses). In contrast to other cooling mechanisms, our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions and should work for a large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, we expect our method to be able to produce ultracold polyatomic molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times of up to 27 seconds should allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling towards a Bose-Einstein condensate of polyatomic molecules.},

Using a tunable light-shift, we render the selected atom off-resonant with a global Rydberg excitation laser which is resonant with the other atom, making it possible to selectively block this atom from being excited to the Rydberg state. Furthermore we demonstrate the controlled manipulation of a two-atom entangled state by using the addressing beam to induce a phase shift onto one component of the wave function of the system, transferring it to a dark state for the Rydberg excitation light. Our results are an important step towards implementing quantum information processing and quantum simulation with large arrays of Rydberg atoms.},

@article{Fischer2005,
abstract = {We review nonlinear optical processes that are specific to chiral molecules in solution and on surfaces. In contrast to conventional natural optical activity phenomena, which depend linearly on the electric field strength of the optical field, we discuss how optical processes that are nonlinear (quadratic, cubic, and quartic) functions of the electromagnetic field strength may probe optically active centers and chiral vibrations. We show that nonlinear techniques open entirely new ways of exploring chirality in chemical and biological systems: The cubic processes give rise to nonlinear circular dichroism and nonlinear optical rotation and make it possible to observe dynamic chiral processes at ultrafast time scales. The quadratic second-harmonic and sum-frequency-generation phenomena and the quartic processes may arise entirely in the electric-dipole approximation and do not require the use of circularly polarized light to detect chirality. They provide surface selectivity and their observables can be relatively much larger than in linear optical activity. These processes also give rise to the generation of light at a new color, and in liquids this frequency conversion only occurs if the solution is optically active. We survey recent chiral nonlinear optical experiments and give examples of their application to problems of biophysical interest.},

abstract = {Traversal of a symmetry-breaking phase transition at finite rates can lead to causally separated regions with incompatible symmetries and the formation of defects at their boundaries, which has a crucial role in quantum and statistical mechanics, cosmology and condensed matter physics. This mechanism is conjectured to follow universal scaling laws prescribed by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Here we determine the scaling law for defect formation in a crystal of 16 laser-cooled trapped ions, which are conducive to the precise control of structural phases and the detection of defects. The experiment reveals an exponential scaling of defect formation $\gamma$($\beta$), where $\gamma$ is the rate of traversal of the critical point and $\beta$=2.68±0.06. This supports the prediction of $\beta$=8/3≈2.67 for finite inhomogeneous systems. Our result demonstrates that the scaling laws also apply in the mesoscopic regime and emphasizes the potential for further tests of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with ion crystals.},

In addition, we also obtain magic wavelengths using the linearly polarized light in order to verify the previously reported values and make a comparative study with the values obtained for the circularly polarized light. Most of these wavelengths are found to be in the optical region and could be of immense interest to the experimentalists for carrying out high precision measurements. To obtain these wavelengths, we have calculated dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the ground, {\$}6p {\~{}}{\{}{\^{}}2{\}}P{\_}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$} and {\$}6p {\~{}}{\{}{\^{}}2{\}}P{\_}{\{}3/2{\}}{\$} states. We use the available precise values of the electric dipole (E1) matrix elements for the most dominantly contributing transitions from the lifetime measurements of the above excited states and obtain other relevant important E1 matrix elements by employing a relativistic coupled-cluster method approximating at the singles and doubles level. Accuracies in these quantities are substantiated by comparing our evaluated scalar polarizability values with the corresponding experimental results.},

The results for the 6,7Li 2 S 1/2 and 2 P 1/2 hyperfine splittings agree very well with the best existing data while those for the D1 isotope shift and 6,7Li fine structure splittings disagree significantly from data obtained by a previous laser atomic beam experiment.

abstract = {We report on the formation of ultracold weakly bound Feshbach molecules of Na23K40, the first fermionic molecule that is chemically stable in its absolute ground state. The lifetime of the nearly degenerate molecular gas exceeds 100 ms in the vicinity of the Feshbach resonance. The measured dependence of the molecular binding energy on the magnetic field demonstrates the open-channel character of the molecules over a wide field range and implies significant singlet admixture. This will enable efficient transfer into the singlet vibrational ground state, resulting in a stable molecular Fermi gas with strong dipolar interactions.},

The derivation is similar to Boltzmannʼs own approach but avoids the use of Lagrangian multipliers. In the Boltzmann–Einstein model, we consider an assembly of boxes. One of the boxes represents the system under consideration, the others act as a thermal reservoir. Energy is distributed over the combined system in discrete portions, not necessarily of quantum character. We derive the probability for the system to have a certain number of energy portions by counting the number of compatible states, thus arriving at the Boltzmann factor.},

abstract = {A quantized Hall plateau of p» — — 31'/e, accompanied by a minimum in p " , was observed at {\&} {\&} 5 K in magnetotransport of high-mobility, bvo-dimensional electrons, when the low-est-energy, spin-polarized Landau level is 3 filled. The formation of a Wigner solid or charge-density-wave state with triangular symmetry is suggested as a possible explana-tion. PACS numbers: 72.20. My, 71.45.-d, 73.40.Lq, 73.60.Fw In the presence of an intense perpendicular magnetic field B, a system of two-dimensional (2D) electrons is expected to form a Wigner sol-id' at low temperatures (T). In the infinite-B limit, an analogy can be drawn to the classical electron gas on the surface of liquid helium, which crystallizes into a solid' when the ratio of the electron's average potential energy to therma1. energy I'=-e'm'{\~{}}'n/ekT=137 (n is the electron areal density). At finite B, quantum effects be-come important and it has been suggested that a charge-density-wave (CDW) state' may be pos-sible at considerabl. y higher T as a precursor to Wigner crystallization. Early experiments were carried out on the Si inversion layer at the Si-SiO, interface. Kawaji and Wakabayashi' and Tsui' made high-B magnetoconductivity measure-ments and observed structures and electric field dependences which cannot be explained by the in-dependent-electron theory of Ando and Uemura. ' Subsequently, Kennedy et al. ' observed a shift in cyclotron resonance, concomitant with a drastic line narrowing, in the high-B limit, when the average electron separation exceeds the cyclo-tron diameter. Wilson, Allen, and Tsui' studied the dependence of this phenomenon on the Landau-level filling factor (v = nb/eB), and found that a pinned-CDW model'o gave the most satisfactory account of the cyclotron resonance data. However, in the range of n at which these experiments were performed, localization due to disorder at the Si-SiO, interface is known to be important even in the absence of B, and consequently, it has not been possible to discern true Coulomb effects from those due to disorder. In this Letter, we report some striking, new results on the transport of high-mobility, 2D electrons, in GaAs-AlGaAs heterojunctions, in the extreme quantum limit (v {\&} I), when the low-est-energy, spin-polarized Landau level is par-tially filled. We found that at temperatures T{\&} 5 K, the diagonal part p " " of the resistivity tensor shows a dip at v = —, ', which becomes stronger at lower T. For v {\&} —, ', p " " follows an approximately exponential increase with inverse T. The Hall resistivity p " " on the other hand, approaches a step of Sh/e' at v = —, ' as T decreases, but re-mains essentially independent of T away from this Hall plateau. These features of the data re-semble those of the quantized Hall resistance and the zero-resistance state expected exclusively for integral values of v. We suggest that these strik-ing results are evidence for a new electronic state at v = —, '. They are consistent with the no-tion that a Wigner solid, or a CDW state with triangular crystal symmetry, is favored at v = —, ' when the unit cell area of the lattice is a multi-ple of the area of a magnetic flux quantum. The samples, consisting of 1-p,m undoped GaAs, 500-A undoped Al, , Ga, Ps, 600-A Si-doped Al, , Ga, gs, and 200-A Si-doped GaAs single crystals were sequentially grown on insulating GaAs substrates using molecular-beam-epitaxy techniques. " The 2D electron gas, resulting from ionized donors placed 500 A inside AlGaAs, " is established at the undoped GaAs side of the GaAs-AlGaAs heterojunction. Samp1. es were cut into standard Hall bridges and Ohmic contacts to the electron layer were made with In at 400'C. Low-field transport measurements were used to deter-mine n and p, . Our samples have n from 1. 1{\~{}}10" to 1.4{\&} 10" cm and p, from 80000 to 100000 cm'/V sec. The high-B measurements were per-formed at the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory, Cambridge, Mass. Figure 1 shows p " , and p " " of one specimen as a function of B at four different temperatures. The scale at the top of the figure shows the Lan-dau level filling factor v, which gives the number of occupied levels. At integral values of v, the data show the characteristic features of the quan-tized Hall plateaus and the vanishing of p " " , " " when the Fermi energy EF is pinned in the gap between two adjacent 1.evels.

abstract = {Chirality-sensitive broadband microwave spectroscopy was performed on mixtures of carvone enantiomers and conformers to distinguish enantiomers, measure enantiomeric excesses, and determine the absolute configurations of the enantiomers. This method uses microwave three-wave mixing and is inherently well-suited to the analysis of mixtures-a unique advantage over other techniques. In contrast to conventional microwave spectroscopy, the phase of the received signal is also exploited. This phase depends upon the signs of the molecules' dipole-moment components and is used to identify the excess enantiomer. The measured signal amplitude determines the size of the excess. The broadband capabilities of the spectrometer were used to simultaneously excite and measure two conformers of carvone, demonstrating the analysis of a sample with multiple chiral species. Employing quantum chemical calculations and the measured phases, the absolute configurations of the enantiomers are determined.},

@incollection{Chupp2010,
abstract = {The permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of a particle or system is a separation of charge along the direction of the total angular momentum of the system and arises from elementary particle interactions that directly violate parity and time-reversal symmetry. Assuming symmetry under combined charge-conjugation, parity, and time-reversal transformations, an EDM is a signal of simultaneous violation of charge-conjugation and parity symmetry (CP violation), and thus probes very weak interactions in the background of much stronger interactions that bind the atom and its nucleus. CP violation arises naturally in the Standard Model of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions through two mechanisms: the phase of a complex amplitude in the weak interactions, the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa phase, which is constrained by measurements with neutral K and B mesons, and the vacuum phase of the strong interaction, $\theta$QCD, which is constrained by EDM measurements. The Standard Model does not, however, appear complete. For example, the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe is not compatible with Standard Model mechanisms of baryogenesis, and CP-violating physics beyond the Standard Model's interactions could produce the observed baryon asymmetry as well as detectable EDMs. For over five decades, experimenters have measured steadily smaller upper limits on the EDMs of atoms, molecules, and elementary particles, and the searches continue with new motivations and new techniques that promise improved sensitivity to CP violation. In this article, we set the stage for contemporary efforts and discuss current and near-term experimental endeavors to measure EDMs in a variety of systems.},

@article{Dalibard1985,
abstract = {We show that the dressed-atom approach provides a quantitative understanding of the main features of radiative dipole forces (mean value, fluctuations, velocity dependence) in the high-intensity limit where perturbative treatments are no longer valid. In an inhomogeneous laser beam, the energies of the dressed states vary in space, and this gives rise to dressed-state-dependent forces. Spontaneous transitions between dressed states lead to a multivalued instantaneous force fluctuating around a mean value. The velocity dependence of the mean force is related to the modification, induced by the atomic motion, of the population balance between the different dressed states. The corresponding modification of the atomic energy is associated with a change of the fluorescence spectrum emitted by the atom. The particular case of atomic motion in a standing wave is investigated, and two regimes are identified in which the mean dipole force averaged over a wavelength exhibits a simple velocity dependence. The large values of this force achievable with reasonable laser powers are pointed out with view to slowing down atoms with dipole},

We parameterize our results so that they can be extended accurately to arbitrary wavelengths above 800 nm. This work is motivated by recent experiments involving simultaneous optical trapping of two different alkali species. Our data can be used to predict the oscillation frequencies of optically-trapped atoms, and particularly the ratios of frequencies of different species held in the same trap. We identify wavelengths at which two different alkali atoms have the same oscillation frequency.},

abstract = {Numerous experiments currently underway offer the potential to indirectly probe new charged particles with masses at the weak scale. For example, the tentative excess in Higgs diphoton decay and the tentative gamma-ray line in Fermi-LAT data have recently attracted attention as possible one-loop signatures of new charged particles. We explore the interplay between such signals, dark matter direct detection through Higgs exchange, and measurements of the electron EDM, by studying the size of these effects in several models. We compute one-loop effects to explore the relationship among couplings probed by different experiments. In particular, models in which dark matter and the Higgs both interact with charged particles at a detectable level typically induce, at loop level, couplings between dark matter and the Higgs that are around the level of current direct detection sensitivity. Intriguingly, one-loop Higgs diphoton decay and DM annihilation into two photons, two-loop EDMs, and loop-induced direct detection rates are all coming within range of existing experiments for approximately the same range of charged particle masses, offering the prospect of an exciting coincidence of signals at collider, astrophysical, underground and atomic physics measurements.},

The presence of argon buffer gas yielded rich rotational relaxation spectra allowing to enlarge the data set for the B(1)(1)Pi state, to obtain Lambda-splittings and to reveal numerous local perturbations. 543 weakly perturbed energy levels for rotational quantum numbers from J(')=5 to 168 and vibrational quantum numbers from v(')=0 to 25, which cover about 87{\%} of the potential well depth, were used for a direct pointwise fit of the potential energy curve applying the inverted perturbation approach method. The resulting potential reproduces the term values for v(')=0-7 with an experimental accuracy of about 0.01-0.02 cm(-1), whereas for v(')=8-25 the deviations increase due to the perturbations, going to the order of 1 cm(-1); an extrapolation is made to the dissociation asymptote.},

abstract = {Considerable efforts are currently devoted to the preparation of ultracold neutral atoms in the strongly correlated quantum Hall regime. However, the necessary angular momentum is very large and in experiments with rotating traps this means spinning frequencies extremely near to the deconfinement limit; consequently, the required control on parameters turns out to be too stringent. Here we propose instead to follow a dynamic path starting from the gas initially confined in a rotating ring. The large moment of inertia of the ring-shaped fluid facilitates the access to large angular momenta, corresponding to giant vortex states. The trapping potential is then adiabatically transformed into a harmonic confinement, which brings the interacting atomic gas in the desired quantum-Hall regime. We provide numerical evidence that for a broad range of initial angular frequencies, the giant-vortex state is adiabatically connected to the bosonic $\nu$ = 1/2 Laughlin state.},

abstract = {The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is known to be incomplete. Extensions to the SM, such as weak-scale Supersymmetry, posit the existence of new particles and interactions that are asymmetric under time-reversal (T), and nearly always predict a small, yet potentially measurable (10(-27)-10(-30) e cm) electron electric dipole moment (EDM, (EDM, {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$displaystyle d{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\$}{\$}). The EDM an asymmetric charge distribution along the spin ({\$}{\$}$\backslash$overrightarrow{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}) that is also asymmetric under T.

To increase the fraction of laser power in the carrier we designed a 20 cm long external cavity diode laser with an intracavity electro-optical modulator. The fractional power in the carrier reaches 99.9{\%}, which corresponds to an rms phase noise of $\phi$(rms)2=1 mrad2 in 10 MHz bandwidth. Using this oscillator, we recorded 1S-2S spectra in atomic hydrogen and have not observed any significant loss of the excitation efficiency due to phase noise multiplication in the three consecutive two-photon processes.},

@article{Roberts2014,
abstract = {We propose methods and present calculations that can be used to search for evidence of cosmic fields by investigating the parity-violating effects, including parity nonconservation amplitudes and electric dipole moments, that they induce in atoms. The results are used to constrain important fundamental parameters describing the strength of the interaction of various cosmic fields with electrons, protons, and neutrons. Candidates for such fields are dark matter (including axions) and dark energy, as well as several more exotic sources described by standard-model extensions. Existing parity nonconservation experiments in Cs, Dy, Yb, and Tl are combined with our calculations to directly place limits on the interaction strength between the temporal component, b{\_}0, of a static pseudovector cosmic field and the atomic electrons, with the most stringent limit of |b{\_}0{\^{}}e| {\textless} 7*10{\^{}}(-15) GeV, in the laboratory frame of reference, coming from Dy. From a measurement of the nuclear anapole moment of Cs, and a limit on its value for Tl, we also extract limits on the interaction strength between the temporal component of this cosmic field, as well as a related tensor cosmic-field component d{\_}00, with protons and neutrons. The most stringent limits of |b{\_}0{\^{}}p| {\textless} 4*10{\^{}}(-8) GeV and |d{\_}00{\^{}}p| {\textless} 5*10{\^{}}(-8) for protons, and |b{\_}0{\^{}}n| {\textless} 2*10{\^{}}(-7) GeV and |d{\_}00{\^{}}n| {\textless} 2*10{\^{}}(-7) for neutrons (in the laboratory frame) come from the results using Cs. Axions may induce oscillating P- and T-violating effects in atoms and molecules through the generation of oscillating nuclear magnetic quadrupole and Schiff moments, which arise from P- and T-odd intranuclear forces and from the electric dipole moments of constituent nucleons. Nuclear-spin-independent parity nonconservation effects may be enhanced in diatomic molecules possessing close pairs of opposite-parity levels in the presence of time-dependent interactions.},

abstract = {Recent measurements in paramagnetic molecules improved the limit on the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) by an order of magnitude. Time-reversal (T) and parity (P) symmetry violation in molecules may also come from their nuclei. We point out that nuclear T,P-odd effects are amplified in paramagnetic molecules containing deformed nuclei, where the primary effects arise from the T,P-odd nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM). We perform calculations of T,P-odd effects in the molecules TaN, ThO, ThF{\$}{\^{}}+{\$}, HfF{\$}{\^{}}+{\$}, YbF, HgF, and BaF induced by MQMs. We compare our results with those for the diamagnetic TlF molecule, where the T,P-odd effects are produced by the nuclear Schiff moment. We argue that measurements in molecules with MQMs may provide improved limits on the strength of T,P-odd nuclear forces, on the proton, neutron and quark EDMs, on quark chromo-EDMs, and on the QCD {\$}\backslashtheta{\$}-term and CP-violating quark interactions.},

@article{Cremer2008,
abstract = {Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of neutral HgX and cationic HgX(+) molecules range from less than a kcal mol(-1) to as much as 60 kcal mol(-1). Using NESC/CCSD(T) [normalized elimination of the small component and coupled-cluster theory with all single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of the triple excitations] in combination with triple-zeta basis sets, bonding in 28 mercury molecules HgX (X = H, Li, Na, K, Rb, CH(3), SiH(3), GeH(3), SnH(3), NH(2), PH(2), AsH(2), SbH(2), OH, SH, SeH, TeH, O, S, Se, Te, F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CF(3), OCF(3)) and their corresponding 28 cations is investigated. Mercury undergoes weak covalent bonding with its partner X in most cases (exceptions: X = alkali atoms, which lead to van der Waals bonding) although the BDEs are mostly smaller than 12 kcal mol(-1). Bonding is weakened by 1) a singly occupied destabilized sigma*-HOMO and 2) lone pair repulsion. The magnitude of sigma*-destabilization can be determined from the energy difference BDE(HgX)-BDE(HgX(+)), which is largest for bonding partners from groups IVb and Vb of the periodic table (up to 80 kcal mol(-1)). BDEs can be enlarged by charge transfer from Hg and increased HgX ionic bonding, provided the bonding partner of Hg is sufficiently electronegative. The fine-tuning of covalent and ionic bonding, sigma-destabilization, and lone-pair repulsion occurs via relativistic effects where 6s AO contraction and 5d AO expansion are decisive. Lone pair repulsion involving the mercury 5d AOs plays an important role in the case of some mercury chalcogenides HgE (E = O, Te) where it leads to (3)Pi rather than (1)Sigma(+) ground states. However, both HgE((3)Pi) and HgE((1)Sigma(+)) should not be experimentally detectable under normal conditions, which is in contrast to experimental predictions suggesting BDE values for HgE between 30 and 53 kcal mol(-1). The results of this work are discussed with regard to their relevance for mercury bonding in general, the chemistry of mercury, and reactions of elemental Hg in the atmosphere.},

The device operates stably under high vacuum conditions at rotational frequencies limited only by commercial dc motor capabilities. Tuning the rotational frequency allows selective scanning over a broad velocity band. The width of the selected velocity distributions at full-width-half-maximum is as narrow as a few percent of the selected mean velocity and independent of the rotational speed of the selector. The selector generates low vibrational noise amplitudes comparable to mechanically damped state-of-the-art turbo-molecular pumps and is therefore compatible with vibration sensitive experiments like molecule interferometry.},

The measured shift, (1.4±2.4)×10-4 Hz, was interpreted as a null result and constitutes a tenfold improvement in sensitivity over the previous measurement. Accordingly, our measurement has reduced the upper limits on the proton and electron electric dipole moments and on other T-violating weak couplings that can be deduced from the frequency shift.},

abstract = {Superconductivity and magnetism generally do not coexist. Changing the relative number of up and down spin electrons disrupts the basic mechanism of superconductivity, where atoms of opposite momentum and spin form Cooper pairs. Nearly forty years ago Fulde and Ferrell and Larkin and Ovchinnikov (FFLO) proposed an exotic pairing mechanism in which magnetism is accommodated by the formation of pairs with finite momentum. Despite intense theoretical and experimental efforts, however, polarized superconductivity remains largely elusive. Unlike the three-dimensional (3D) case, theories predict that in one dimension (1D) a state with FFLO correlations occupies a major part of the phase diagram. Here we report experimental measurements of density profiles of a two-spin mixture of ultracold (6)Li atoms trapped in an array of 1D tubes (a system analogous to electrons in 1D wires). At finite spin imbalance, the system phase separates with an inverted phase profile, as compared to the 3D case. In 1D, we find a partially polarized core surrounded by wings which, depending on the degree of polarization, are composed of either a completely paired or a fully polarized Fermi gas. Our work paves the way to direct observation and characterization of FFLO pairing.},

@article{Okumura1987,
abstract = {Recently the presence and radiative decay of vibrationally excited CH2-, generated in a hot cathode discharge CH4, was established by measuring the time dependent photodetachment from excited states of CH2- as it radiatively relaxed in a high vacuum ion trap. The time dependence of the photodetachment was consistent with an electron affinity of 5250 cm-1 (0.65 eV) for ground state X.hivin.3B1 methylene. The radiative decay lifetimes of the 1st 3 excited bending vibrations of CH2- were also tentatively assigned. A more refined anal. is reported of the exptl. data along with theor. ab initio dets. of the radiative decay lifetimes of the 1st 4 excited bending vibrational levels of CH2-. There is some discrepancy between the ab initio values (431, 207, 118, and 68 ms for the v2 = 1, 2, 3, and 4 levels resp.) and the exptl. values (525, 70, and 14 ms for v2 = 1, 2, and 3 resp.) for v2 = 2 and 3. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed, but none of the alternatives are entirely satisfactory. [on SciFinder(R)]},

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {Chemical reactions can be surprisingly efficient at ultracold temperatures ( < 1mK) due to the wave nature of atoms and molecules. The study of reactions in the ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping techniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold molecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric dipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting many-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing ultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state, where single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The scheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and coherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate quantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a single Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter wavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more diverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full quantum control.},

By using a microscopic optical resonator, we achieved such interactions and demonstrated a robust, efficient mechanism for the regulated transport of photons one by one. With critical coupling of the input light, a single atom within the resonator dynamically controls the cavity output conditioned on the photon number at the input, thereby functioning as a photon turnstile. We verified the transformation from a Poissonian to a sub-Poissonian photon stream by photon counting measurements of the input and output fields. The results have applications in quantum information science, including for controlled interactions of single light quanta and for scalable quantum processing on atom chips.},

  abstract = {Bosons are a type of particle that likes to congregate. This property has a major effect on the behavior of identical bosons. Kaufman et al. demonstrated quantum interference of two bosonic Rb atoms placed in two neighboring quantum wells (see the Perspective by Thompson and Lukin). They prepared the atoms in exactly the same state so that there would be no way to tell them apart except for which well each atom was in. They then monitored the probability of the two atoms still being in separate wells. At certain times, the probability had a characteristic dip signifying that the bosons preferred to be in the same well.Science, this issue p. 306; see also p. 272The quantum statistics of atoms is typically observed in the behavior of an ensemble via macroscopic observables. However, quantum statistics modifies the behavior of even two particles. Here, we demonstrate near-complete control over all the internal and external degrees of freedom of two laser-cooled 87Rb atoms trapped in two optical tweezers. This controllability allows us to observe signatures of indistinguishability via two-particle interference. Our work establishes laser-cooled atoms in optical tweezers as a promising route to bottom-up engineering of scalable, low-entropy quantum systems.},

  abstract = {For a quantum computer to be useful, its qubits have to be able to change their state in response to external stimuli. But when a large number of qubits are packed in a three-dimensional (3D) structure to optimize the use of space, altering one qubit can unintentionally change the state of others. Wang et al. devised a clever way to perform high-fidelity quantum gates only on intended qubits in a 3D array of Cs atoms. Although the operation initially changed the state of some of the other atoms, additional manipulation recovered their original state. The technique may be applicable to other quantum computing implementations.Science, this issue p. 1562Although the quality of individual quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates has been steadily improving, the number of qubits in a single system has increased quite slowly. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary single-qubit gates based on targeted phase shifts, an approach that can be applied to atom, ion, or other atom-like systems. These gates are highly insensitive to addressing beam imperfections and have little cross-talk, allowing for a dramatic scaling up of qubit number. We have performed gates in series on 48 individually targeted sites in a 40\% full 5 by 5 by 5 three-dimensional array created by an optical lattice. Using randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate an average gate fidelity of 0.9962(16), with an average cross-talk fidelity of 0.9979(2) (numbers in parentheses indicate the one standard deviation uncertainty in the final digits).},
