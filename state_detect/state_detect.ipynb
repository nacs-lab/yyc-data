      "## Goals\n",
      "In order to do Raman sideband cooling and STIRAP, we need hyperfine state detection and manipulation. This includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Optical pumping to a single Zeeman level (without too much heating)\n",
      "2. Imaging of atom in a specific Zeeman level (at least for the stretched state)\n",
      "3. Raman spectroscopy (Raman transition plus state dependent imaging)\n",
      "4. Sideband cooling\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methods and requirements\n",
      "### Optical pumping\n",
      "Since we don't want too much heating during the pumping process, we need dark state pumping. Without a strong magnetic field, the only way to do it AFAIK is pumping on a $F \\rightarrow F$ transition with $\\sigma_\\pm$ light.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Transitions to use\n",
      "For Cesium, we should be able to use the $F4'$ state in the $P_{3/2}$ manifold. For sodium, however, since the separation between the $F2'$ and $F3'$ state is only $6\\ (5.95)$ linewidth and the coupling to the cycling transition in $F3'$ is $6$ times stronger, there will be significant off-resonance coupling and may introduce a lot of heating. It is probably possible to do the initial pumping on this line but we might want to pump on the $D1$ line to minimize this issue for sideband cooling where it matters a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Requirements\n",
      "For free space dark state pumping, the main requirements are the alignment between the beam and the field as well as the polarization of the beam. These can be done with the atoms from the MOT although we need to be a little bit careful about the waveplates we use and make sure that we can get the best polarization inside the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the requirements from free space pumping, pumping in a tightly focused optical tweezer introduce more problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the frequency of the pumping light needs to be slightly detuned from the free space transition because of the light shift (tens of MHz).\n",
      "\n",
      "The bigger issue is the vector light shift caused by the difference of AC Stark effect on the $D1$ and $D2$ transitions. According to [Mikhail's Raman sideband cooling paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3028), the vector shift in the ground state is given by\n",
      "\n",
      "$$U(\\vec r)=-U_0(\\vec r)\\frac{\\delta_2-\\delta_1}{\\delta_2+2\\delta_1}\\vec C(\\vec r)\\cdot g_F\\vec F$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $\\delta_1$ ($\\delta_2$) is the detuning of the trapping light from the $D1$ ($D2$) line and $\\vec C=\\Im[\\vec\\varepsilon\\times\\vec\\varepsilon^*]$ is _\"a basis-independent way of expressing the normal vector of the polarization ellipse and the degree of ellipticity\"_\n",
      "\n",
      "This can also be treated as a effective magnetic field\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\vec B=-\\frac{U_0}{\\mu_B}\\frac{\\delta_2-\\delta_1}{\\delta_2+2\\delta_1}\\vec C$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The direction of this field is perpendicular to the polarization of the light and the direction of propagation so it doesn't interfere with the optical pumping if the external field we apply is stronger than this effective field and is parallel with it. However, due to the state dependent effect of this field on the trapping potential, we need to apply a field that is perpendicular to it and the field will affect the alignment between the beam and the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the same paper, the maximum gradient of the polarization $\\dfrac{\\text{d}C}{\\text{d}x}$ appears at the focus and is given by $A\\dfrac{\\alpha\\sin\\alpha}{\\lambda}$ where $\\alpha$ is the numerical aperture and $A$ is a factor depending on the illumination which is $3.1$ for uniform and $2.6$ for Gaussian. The maximum of this effective field appears roughly $\\dfrac{\\lambda}{2}$ from the focus.\n",
